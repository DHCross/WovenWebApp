# How to use Tailwind CSS in this project

## For development (live preview):
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run:
   npm install
   npm run dev:tailwind
3. Leave that terminal window open while you work. It will automatically update dist/output.css as you edit index.html.
4. Reload your site in the browser to see style changes.

## For production (final build):
1. Run:
   npm run build:css
2. This will generate a minimized dist/output.css for production use.

## If you want to switch back to the CDN for quick testing:
- In index.html, replace:
  <link href="dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
  with:
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

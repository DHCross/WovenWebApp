## Usage Guidelines

### When Starting New Work

1. **Always read** [`Four Report Types_Integrated 10.1.25.md`](Four%20Report%20Types_Integrated%2010.1.25.md) first
2. Check supporting docs for implementation details
3. Cross-reference with `/Implementation/` for technical specs
4. Verify with `/Poetic Brain/` for voice/persona requirements

### When Conflicts Arise

**Precedence Order:**
1. Four Report Types_Integrated 10.1.25.md (PRIMARY)
2. UNIFIED_REPORT_STRUCTURE.md (structural details)
3. Other documentation (context only)

If you find conflicting information, the Four Report Types document takes precedence.

### Updating Core Documents

**Critical:** Core documents should be updated with extreme care.

**Process:**
1. Discuss proposed changes with project owner (Jules/DHCross)
2. Document reason for change in CHANGELOG.md
3. Update all cross-references in other docs
4. Run full test suite
5. Update "Last Updated" date in this README

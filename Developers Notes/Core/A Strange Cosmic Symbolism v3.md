# **A Strange Cosmic Symbolism — Balance Meter v3**

⸻

Core Principle — Map, Don’t Moralize

This is a symbolic weather map for inner and relational fields. It shows: • How loud the day is (Magnitude). • Which way it leans (Directional Bias). • How stable the storyline is (Coherence). • Whether forces work together or fragment (Integration Bias / SFD).

It never predicts behavior. It produces a climate readout that invites testable reflection. • Sky geometry yields objective axes. • Daily experience is logged alongside, never assumed identical. • House placement grounds abstraction in lived domains: where the pressure lands.

⸻

The Four Axes (Neutral)

1\) Magnitude (0–5) — How loud is the field? • 0–1 Background hum. • 2–3 Noticeable motifs. • 4 Strong clustering, palpable weight. • 5 Peak storm, chapter-defining. Derived from raw aspect intensities; never suppressed into decimals.

⸻

2\) Directional Bias (−5 → \+5) — Which way is the flow leaning? • −5 Maximum contraction / inward / enforced boundary. • 0 Neutral balance. • \+5 Maximum expansion / outward / boundary-dissolving.

Directional, not moral. Expansion can overwhelm; contraction can protect. Both must surface.

⸻

3\) Narrative Coherence (0–5) — How stable is the story? • 0–1 Single-thread clarity. • 2 Mostly coherent; minor counter-pulls. • 3 Mixed storyline; ambiguous. • 4 Splintered; contradictory threads. • 5 Chaotic; no stable arc.

⸻

4\) Integration Bias (SFD, −1 → \+1) — Do forces cooperate or fragment? • \> 0 Net supportive — cooperation, stabilisation. • 0 Neutral — outcome depends on choice. • \< 0 Net friction — fragmentation, opposition.

SFD is the honesty check: prevents “red-wall bias” (crisis everywhere) or “greenwash bias” (false harmony).

⸻

Houses — Where Pressure Lands

Domains grounded by relocation: • I. Self — body, resources, expression. • II. Connection — communication, partnerships, networks. • III. Growth — home, shared load, horizon. • IV. Responsibility — work, career, dissolution.

Same sky, different rooms.

⸻

Sources of Force (Geometry → Scores) • 🎯 Orb: closeness \= strength. • ∠ Aspect: majors roar, minors whisper. • 🪐 Potency: slower planets \= tectonic, faster \= sparks. • 📡 Resonance: amplifies at Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, Nodes. • ♾ Recursion: repeated themes echo louder.

Glyphs are clean: 🌀 \= Coherence 5, 🌫 \= Fog, ⚡ \= Magnitude only.

⸻

Orbs — Gatekeepers

Tight orbs sharpen intensity, keep valence honest, and prevent soft trines from “padding” positivity. Loose orbs capture climate background but blur the storyline. • Tight (surgical): ≤3° majors, ≤1° minors. • Loose (climate): ≤6° luminaries, ≤4° planets, ≤3° points, ≤1° minors.

Orbs remain quantitative filters only; they don’t moralize interpretation. Always stamp orbs\_profile for auditability.

⸻

Resilience & Depletion Layer

An add-on that combines symbolic scores with physiology (if logged). • Stress Event: high magnitude \+ negative bias. • Load: cumulative contraction pressure. • Recovery: rebound within 1–2 days. • Resilience: rolling index of recovery success. • Depletion: quiet ≠ stable; flags collapse under low-magnitude, negative, fragmented days.

Keeps the model falsifiable against real resilience metrics (HRV, sleep, mood).

⸻

Narrative Layer (Optional)

Never moralize bias. Use motion words: extend, retract, concentrate, disperse.

Templates: • Supportive, coherent expansion: Outward lean, steady storyline, aligned forces. • Supportive, fragmented expansion: Outward lean, scattered openings. • Restrictive, coherent: Inward lean, clean arc, distillation. • Restrictive, fragmented: Inward lean, cross-pulls, rising pressure.

⸻

Reading a Day 1\. Score all four axes. 2\. Locate the houses. 3\. Combine: Bias × Magnitude × Coherence × SFD. 4\. Name one symbolic behavior consistent with the field. 5\. Log lived outcome in neutral, testable terms.

⸻

Reconciliation Notes • Restores signed Directional Bias (−5 ↔ \+5). • Keeps Magnitude real (0 ↔ 5 full scale). • Clarifies Coherence as story stability. • Centers SFD as differential honesty. • Orbs kept as gatekeepers, not distorters.

⸻

Glossary • Magnitude: loudness of archetypal charge. • Directional Bias: contraction vs. expansion. • Coherence: story stability. • SFD: supportive vs. frictional net force. • WB/ABE/OSR: shorthand for outcome fit.

Balance Meter v3 is the symbolic seismograph reborn. It surfaces real storms (like Oct 10, 2018\) instead of flattening them. It maps the climate, never dictates the story.

⸻

Got it — you want Balance Meter v3 as the clarified, reconciled spec, but also to preserve the old lexicon so nothing gets lost in translation. That way, magnitude vs. numinosity, valence vs. bias, etc., can still be cross-referenced. Here’s the rewrite with an embedded “Lexicon Bridge” section:

A Strange Cosmic Symbolism — Balance Meter v3

⸻

Core Principle — Map, Don’t Moralize

A symbolic weather map for inner and relational fields. It shows: •	How loud the day is (Magnitude). •	Which way it leans (Directional Bias). •	How stable the storyline is (Coherence). •	Whether forces work together or fragment (Integration Bias / SFD).

It never predicts behavior — it surfaces fields for testable reflection.

⸻

The Four Axes

1) Magnitude (0–5) — How loud is the field?

(Formerly: “Numinosity”) •	0–1 Latent hum. •	2–3 Noticeable motifs. •	4 Palpable weight. •	5 Peak storm; chapter-defining.

⸻

2) Directional Bias (−5 → \+5) — Which way is the flow leaning?

(Formerly: “Valence”) •	−5 Maximum contraction (inward, enforced boundary). •	0 Neutral balance. •	\+5 Maximum expansion (outward, dissolved boundary).

Directional ≠ moral. Expansion can overwhelm; contraction can protect.

⸻

3) Narrative Coherence (0–5) — How stable is the story?

(Formerly: “Volatility”) •	0–1 Single-thread clarity. •	2 Mostly coherent. •	3 Ambiguous pulls. •	4 Splintered. •	5 Chaotic.

⸻

4) Integration Bias (−1 → \+1) — Do forces cooperate or fragment?

(Formerly: “Support/Friction Differential, SFD”) •	\> 0 Supportive alignment. •	0 Neutral. •	\< 0 Frictional opposition.

Acts as reality check, preventing red-wall (all crisis) or greenwash (all harmony).

⸻

Lexicon Bridge (Old ↔ New)

To preserve continuity with prior drafts:

Old Term	New Term (v3)	Core Meaning Numinosity	Magnitude	Raw intensity / “charge” of symbolic weather. Valence	Directional Bias	Lean of energy: inward contraction vs. outward expansion. Volatility	Narrative Coherence	How stable or fragmented the symbolic storyline is. SFD (Support/Friction Differential)	Integration Bias	Net cooperation vs. opposition of forces. Greenwash	False Support	Spurious positivity from wide/weak trines/sextiles. Red-wall bias	False Crisis	Overweighting hard aspects without stabilisers. Magnitude/Numinosity “⚡”	Charge Index	Icon shorthand for intensity spikes. Directional Compass	Bias Scale (−5 to \+5)	Vector of flow. Noise / Quiet	Low Mag \+ Negative Bias \+ Low SFD	False calm, depletion zone.

This preserves interpretive lineage — old reports can be re-read against the v3 axes without loss.

Houses — Where Pressure Lands

Domains grounded by relocation: •	I. Self — body, resources, expression. •	II. Connection — communication, partnerships, networks. •	III. Growth — home, intimacy, horizon. •	IV. Responsibility — work, career, dissolution.

Same sky, different rooms.

⸻

Sources of Force (Geometry → Scores) •	Orb closeness \= strength. •	Aspects: majors roar, minors whisper. •	Planetary speed: outers tectonic, inners sparky. •	Resonance: amplifiers at Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, Nodes. •	Recursion: repeated motifs echo louder.

⸻

Orbs — Gatekeepers •	Tight orbs (surgical) \= exact hits, testable against lived events. •	Loose orbs (climate) \= ambient atmosphere, season-level.

Always stamp orbs\_profile for auditability. Tight mode defends falsifiability.

⸻

Resilience & Depletion Layer

Extra diagnostic: •	Stress \= high mag \+ negative bias. •	Load \= cumulative contraction. •	Recovery \= rebound signals. •	Resilience \= rolling success at recovery. •	Depletion \= false calm (quiet \+ negative \+ fragmented).

⸻

Narrative Layer

Motion words only: extend, retract, concentrate, disperse.

Examples: •	Outward, coherent, supportive → “Expansion with clarity; aligned openings.” •	Outward, fragmented → “Expansion with scatter; openings disperse fast.” •	Inward, coherent → “Restriction with focus; distillation possible.” •	Inward, fragmented → “Restriction under cross-pulls; conserve energy.”

⸻

How to Read a Day 1\.	Score all 4 axes. 2\.	Locate by houses (relocated). 3\.	Combine: Bias × Magnitude × Coherence × Integration. 4\.	Pick one symbolic behavior that matches. 5\.	Log outcome neutrally (WB/ABE/OSR).

⸻

Reconciliation Notes •	Restored signed bias (−5 → \+5). •	Kept Magnitude real (0–5) instead of washed out averages. •	Renamed Volatility → Coherence (clearer). •	Centered SFD → Integration Bias as sanity check. •	Lexicon preserved for continuity with old reports.

⸻

Glossary Quickref •	Magnitude (Numinosity): intensity of the symbolic weather. •	Directional Bias (Valence): contraction vs. expansion lean. •	Coherence (Volatility): story stability. •	Integration Bias (SFD): net support vs. friction. •	WB/ABE/OSR: Within Boundary / At Boundary Edge / Off-Signature Reversal.

⸻

Balance Meter v3 \= Symbolic Seismograph reborn. It restores contraction and expansion to both sides of the scale. It bridges old and new language so all prior logs remain legible.

# Save/Load Functionality Fix - January 2025

## Issue
After adding the Report Type selector (Solo/Synastry/Composite), the save/load functionality broke because `reportStructure` was not being saved to or restored from JSON files.

## Root Cause
The `reportStructure` state variable was added to the UI but was missing from:
1. The `handleSaveSetupJSON()` function - not included in saved data
2. The `handleLoadSetupFromFile()` function - not restored when loading
3. The `loadSavedSession()` function - not restored from sessions

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Save Function ([page.tsx:3193](../app/math-brain/page.tsx#L3193))
Added `reportStructure` to the inputs object being saved:

```typescript
const inputs: any = {
  schema: 'mb-1',
  mode,
  step,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  includePersonB,
  translocation,
  reportStructure, // ADDED: Save report type (solo/synastry/composite)
  personA,
  personB,
  // ... rest of fields
};
```

### 2. Updated Load Function ([page.tsx:3397-3400](../app/math-brain/page.tsx#L3397-L3400))
Added restoration of `reportStructure` when loading files:

```typescript
// ADDED: Load report structure (solo/synastry/composite)
if (typeof data.reportStructure === 'string' && ['solo', 'synastry', 'composite'].includes(data.reportStructure)) {
  setReportStructure(data.reportStructure as ReportStructure);
}
```

### 3. Updated Session Restore ([page.tsx:3454-3457](../app/math-brain/page.tsx#L3454-L3457))
Added restoration of `reportStructure` when resuming sessions:

```typescript
// ADDED: Restore report structure from session
if (typeof inputs.reportStructure === 'string' && ['solo', 'synastry', 'composite'].includes(inputs.reportStructure)) {
  setReportStructure(inputs.reportStructure as ReportStructure);
}
```

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. **Save A**:
   - Set Report Type to Solo/Synastry/Composite
   - Click "Save A"
   - Verify JSON file contains `"reportStructure": "solo"` (or synastry/composite)

2. **Load Setup**:
   - Load a JSON file with `reportStructure` field
   - Verify the Report Type selector shows the correct value

3. **Session Resume**:
   - Generate a report
   - Refresh page
   - Click "Resume from last session"
   - Verify Report Type is restored

## Files Modified
- [app/math-brain/page.tsx](../app/math-brain/page.tsx)
  - Line 3193: Added `reportStructure` to save
  - Lines 3397-3400: Added `reportStructure` to load
  - Lines 3454-3457: Added `reportStructure` to session restore

## Validation
The fix includes type checking to ensure only valid values ('solo', 'synastry', 'composite') are restored, preventing potential errors from corrupted or modified JSON files.

## Related
This fix is part of ensuring all form state is properly persisted. Similar issues could occur if other state variables are added without updating save/load functions.

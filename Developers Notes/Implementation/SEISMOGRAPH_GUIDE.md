# Woven Map Seismograph Guide

> Geometry-first diagnostic scaffold. Mirror, not mandate.

## Overview
The Seismograph is a core innovation of The Woven Map: a quantified lens translating raw planetary geometry into three auditable axes of experiential field dynamics:

- **Magnitude (0–5 normalized)** – Symbolic field intensity using safe lexicon: Whisper, Pulse, Wave, Surge, Peak, Apex. Neutral intensity markers only.
- **Valence (-5..+5 annotation)** – Directional charge with emoji indicators: 🌑 Negative (🌋⚔🌊🌀🌫🕰) vs 🌞 Positive (🌱🔥✨🦋💎). Rich semantic types.
- **Volatility (0–5)** – Turbulence / instability (rate + amplitude of change in activation field).

These are **three independent dials**, not a derived chain.

```
Magnitude → "How intense is the field?" (Whisper → Apex)
Valence   → "What's the directional charge?" (🌑 vs 🌞)
Volatility→ "Is it steady or turbulent?"
```

## Safe Lexicon System
### Magnitude Terms (Neutral Intensity Only)
- **Whisper** (0–0.5) - Minimal field activation
- **Pulse** (0.5–1.5) - Light rhythmic intensity  
- **Wave** (1.5–2.5) - Moderate field flow
- **Surge** (2.5–3.5) - Strong current intensity
- **Peak** (3.5–4.5) - High amplitude activation
- **Apex** (4.5–5.0) - Maximum field intensity

### Valence Types with Emoji Indicators
#### 🌑 Negative Valence (Resistance/Challenge)
- 🌋 **Pressure/Eruption** (-4.5 to -5.0) - Compression until release, shadow surges
- ⚔ **Friction Clash** (-3.5 to -4.5) - Conflict, heat, accidents
- 🌊 **Cross Current** (-2.5 to -3.5) - Competing priorities, confusion
- 🌀 **Fog/Dissolution** (-1.5 to -2.5) - Blurred signals, loss of clarity
- 🌫 **Entropy Drift** (-0.8 to -1.5) - Inertia, drain, loss of momentum
- 🕰 **Saturn Weight** (-0.2 to -0.8) - Heaviness, delay, endurance test

#### 🌞 Positive Valence (Support/Flow)
- 🌱 **Fertile Field** (+0.2 to +0.8) - Growth, opportunity, new shoots
- 🌊 **Flow Tide** (+0.8 to +1.5) - Smooth adaptability, emotional ease
- ✨ **Harmonic Resonance** (+1.5 to +2.5) - Natural ease, things click
- 🔥 **Combustion Clarity** (+2.5 to +3.5) - Insight breaks through
- 🦋 **Liberation/Release** (+3.5 to +4.5) - Breakthroughs, freedom
- 💎 **Expansion Lift** (+4.5 to +5.0) - Abundance, confidence

#### ⚖ Neutral Balance (-0.2 to +0.2) - Equilibrium stategraph Guide

## Overview
The Seismograph is a core innovation of The Woven Map: a quantified lens translating raw planetary geometry into three auditable axes of experiential pressure:

- **Magnitude (0–5 normalized)** – Symbolic pressure intensity (weighted hook density & alignment). Standalone scalar.
- **Valence (-5..+5 annotation)** – Directional tone (supportive tailwind vs frictional headwind).
- **Volatility (0–5)** – Turbulence / instability (rate + amplitude of change in activation field).

These are **three independent dials**, not a derived chain.

```
Magnitude → “How strong is the storm?”
Valence   → “Is it with me or against me?”
Volatility→ “Is it steady or ragged?”
```

## Dual Scales
| Axis | Scale | Meaning | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| Magnitude | 0–5 (norm) | Pressure intensity | Raw 0–10 kept internally for audit |
| Valence | -5..+5 | Directional tone | Benefic/malefic weighting + aspect harmony/tension |
| Volatility | 0–5 | Stability vs turbulence | Spread & temporal churn of hooks |

## Macro View: Seismograph Arc
1. **Normalized Activation Curve (Magnitude 0–5)** – Peaks = clusters / stacked weighting (outer planets, tight orbs, sensitive natal points).
2. **Valence Drift Path (-5..+5)** – Qualitative directional trajectory (supportive vs destabilizing runs).
3. **Quadrant Reading** – High Mag + Negative Valence ≠ High Mag + Positive Valence (distinct phenomenology).

| Quadrant | Example | Diagnostic Flavor |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| High Mag / + Val | M=4.1 V=+3.2 | Breakthrough runway / momentum window |
| High Mag / - Val | M=4.3 V=-3.0 | Compression / friction pivot |
| Low Mag / - Val | M=1.4 V=-2.1 | Irritation / background drag |
| Low Mag / + Val | M=1.2 V=+2.4 | Pleasant ease / low activation |

## Micro View: Daily Barometer
- **Daily Bar Pulse** – Magnitude for the 24‑hour slice.
- **Valence Annotation** – Precise directional score (V:+2.7 / V:-4.1).
- **Volatility Shading** – Pattern / stripe density indicates turbulence (high volatility = spiky, distributive energy).
- **Semantic Snapshot (single-day)** – Title + glyph stack (⚡☍⧖) + short annotation when only one day is selected.

## How Magnitude Is Computed (Conceptual – not code)
Weighted aggregation of:
- Planetary class (outer > social > personal > points)
- Aspect type (Conj > Opposition > Square > Trine > Sextile > Minor/Harmonic tiers)
- Orb tightness (decaying weight curve)
- Stack density (simultaneous reinforcing transits)
- Sensitivity multipliers (angles, luminaries, nodal / Chiron emphasis)

Result → Raw 0–10 → Normalized to 0–5 envelope after scaling strategy pass (with confidence metric).

## Valence Determinants
- Benefic vs malefic signatures (weighted by era & dignity ruleset)
- Aspect harmony/tension classification
- Composite structural reinforcement / mitigation
- Directional drift (net vector over recent window)

## Volatility Determinants
- Intra-window variance of magnitude deltas
- Hook turnover rate (appearance / decay cadence)
- Competing directional vectors (mixed valence clusters)

## Integrity & Falsifiability
- **Raw Audit Trail**: Raw magnitudes retained (0–10) for regression and threshold tuning.
- **Scale Confidence**: Reported when normalization heuristics had a limited sampling window (< target days) or fragmented input.
- **Miss Logging**: Non‑confirming phenomenology is data, not failure—feeds classification refinement.

## Dual Brain Architecture
| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| Math Brain | Deterministic geometry → Magnitude / Valence / Volatility metrics (no narrative) |
| Poetic Brain (Raven) | Salience, metaphor, Socratic mirrors, narrative restraint |

Filtering thresholds, pattern naming, and emotional resonance belong to **Poetic Brain**. The Seismograph only supplies calibrated coordinates.

## Usage Guidance
1. **Mirror First** – Read the triad without forcing story.
2. **Locate Quadrant** – Identify intensity + tone before nuance.
3. **Check Volatility** – Decide pacing / regulation strategy.
4. **Then Interpret** – Only after geometry is accepted.

## Quick Legend
- ⚡ High volatility (>=3)
- ☍ Friction / opposition cluster (valence ≤ -3)
- ⧖ Pressure hold (high Mag + negative Val)
- ∿ Scatter (high volatility + neutral Val)
- ↗ Momentum (Mag>=3 & Val>=2)

## FAQ
**Q: Are the three numbers combined anywhere?**  
A: No. Deliberately independent to prevent false composites.

**Q: Why normalize Magnitude?**  
A: UX legibility + cross-period comparability; raw retained for audit.

**Q: Can Valence be zero with high Magnitude?**  
A: Yes—structural pressure without directional tilt (ambiguous pivot field).

**Q: Where can I find detailed explanations of valence types?**  
A: The seismograph interface includes an expanded glossary (📖 Glossary button) with comprehensive valence maps, including detailed descriptions of negative and positive valence types, sources of force, and quick navigation guidance.

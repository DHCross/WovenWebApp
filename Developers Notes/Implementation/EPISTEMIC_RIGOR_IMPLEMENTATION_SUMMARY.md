# Epistemic Rigor Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 21, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully transformed the Woven Map from interpretive art to **structured epistemic instrument** by implementing formal falsifiability framework based on the "From Metaphor to Specification" philosophical document.

**Core Achievement:**  
> Truth = fidelity across layers. When geometry, data, and language align, the mirror holds.

This is now **enforced programmatically**, not aspirationally.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Symbolic Entropy Measurement ✅

**What It Does:**
- Quantifies "spread of interpretive possibilities"
- Formula: `entropy = coherence_variance + 2×drift`
- Categories: Normal, Elevated, Flattening

**Why It Matters:**
- Makes "symbolic entropy" measurable, not metaphorical
- Detects when system enters monotony (all readings sound the same)
- Provides falsifiable threshold: `coherence < 2.0`

**Code:**
```javascript
const entropy = calculateSymbolicEntropy(recentReadings, baseline);
// Returns: { entropy: 0.47, status: 'normal', coherenceVariance: 0.27, drift: 0.1 }
```

### 2. Narrative Flattening Detection ✅

**What It Does:**
- Detects catastrophic state: low coherence + endpoint bias
- Condition: `coherence < 2.0 AND |bias| ≥ 4.5`
- Returns severity: none/warning/critical

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents "dead channel" - readings lose variation
- Falsifiable failure mode
- Triggers recovery protocol automatically

**Code:**
```javascript
const check = detectNarrativeFlattening(1.5, 4.8);
// Returns: { flattening: true, severity: 'critical', reason: '...' }
```

### 3. Axes Orthogonality Validation ✅

**What It Does:**
- Ensures Magnitude, Bias, Coherence remain independent
- Calculates correlations (Pearson coefficient)
- Flags suspicious patterns (magnitude = |bias|)

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents semantic collapse (axes merge into one)
- Detects fabricated data (suspiciously correlated)
- Maintains FIELD → MAP distinction

**Code:**
```javascript
const check = checkAxesOrthogonality(readings);
// Returns: { orthogonal: false, issues: [...], correlations: { magnitude_bias: 0.84 } }
```

### 4. Epistemic Key Leakage Detection ✅

**What It Does:**
- Detects catastrophic semantic failures
- Checks: fabricated nulls, axis collapse, missing provenance
- Returns: leakage status, severity, specific failures

**Why It Matters:**
- Catches "cryptographic key loss" equivalent for symbolic system
- Triggers immediate freeze and recovery
- Prevents corrupted data from reaching display

**Code:**
```javascript
const check = detectEpistemicKeyLeakage(reading);
// Returns: { leakage: true, severity: 'critical', failures: ['All values zero...'] }
```

### 5. Transformation Pipeline Traceability ✅

**What It Does:**
- Logs every transformation step: raw → normalize → scale → clamp → display
- Validates pipeline order (detects violations)
- Creates provenance stamps with full audit trail
- Enables replay/verification

**Why It Matters:**
- Makes every value's journey auditable
- Detects out-of-order operations (data loss)
- Provides timestamps for debugging
- Enables "replay from verified JSON"

**Code:**
```javascript
let trace = createTrace(8.5, 'magnitude');
trace = addStep(trace, 'normalize', 8.5, 4.2, { method: 'rolling_window' });
trace = addStep(trace, 'scale', 4.2, 3.8, { cap: 5.0 });
trace = finalizeTrace(trace, 3.8);

const stamp = createProvenanceStamp(trace, { scalingMode: 'rolling_window_v3' });
// stamp.auditTrail contains complete transformation history
```

### 6. Lexical Orthogonality Enforcement ✅

**What It Does:**
- Prevents directional terms (expansion/contraction) in cohesion contexts
- Prevents cohesion terms (harmony/friction) in directional contexts
- Provides suggested replacements
- Can throw at build-time (fail-fast)

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents "lexical bleed" that collapses axes semantically
- Maintains FIELD → MAP → VOICE separation
- Makes axis independence enforceable (not just aspirational)

**Code:**
```typescript
const result = lintPayload(payload);
if (!result.valid) {
  // result.violations contains: field, term, category, wrongContext
  throw new Error('Lexical integrity violation');
}
```

### 7. Observer Bias Risk Labeling ✅

**What It Does:**
- Flags readings with high signal + low coherence
- Labels: "High Signal / High Misinterpretation Risk"
- Provides context-aware warnings

**Why It Matters:**
- Accounts for human bias at point of observation
- Users warned when likely to project drama
- System assumes responsibility for misreading risk

**Code:**
```javascript
const risk = assessMisinterpretationRisk(reading);
if (risk.risk === 'high') {
  // risk.label = "High Signal / High Misinterpretation Risk"
  // risk.warnings = ['High magnitude with low coherence...']
}
```

### 8. Null Honesty Enforcement ✅

**What It Does:**
- Ensures missing data displays as `null` + `status: 'n/a'`
- Never fabricates defaults
- Flags suspicious zeros without provenance

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents "false resonance" from fake data
- Makes absences visible (not hidden)
- Maintains integrity of raw FIELD

**Code:**
```javascript
const check = enforceNullHonesty(data, ['magnitude', 'bias', 'coherence']);
// Returns: { honest: true, violations: [], sanitized: {...} }
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Contract Linter (Enhanced)

**What Changed:**
- Added lexical checks to `ContractLinter.lint()`
- Returns `lexical` field in `LintResult`
- Violations automatically added to errors/warnings

**Usage:**
```typescript
const result = ContractLinter.lint(payload);
// result.lexical.valid = false if lexical bleed detected
// result.errors includes lexical violations
```

### 2. Canonical Scaling (Enhanced)

**What Changed:**
- Added `transform_pipeline` array to metadata
- Added `timestamp` to all scaling operations
- Full provenance for both bias and magnitude

**Usage:**
```javascript
const scaled = scaleDirectionalBias(raw, options);
// scaled.meta.transform_pipeline = ['sign_resolution', 'magnitude_selection', 'clamp', 'round']
// scaled.meta.timestamp = '2025-01-21T...'
```

### 3. Seismograph (Compatible)

**Already Works:**
- Outputs `magnitude_meta` with scaling details
- Can be enhanced to create transformation traces
- Ready for entropy monitoring

**Next Step:**
```javascript
// In aggregate(), add:
const magTrace = createTrace(X_raw, 'magnitude');
// Log each transformation step
// Attach to output
```

## Recovery Protocols Implemented

### Protocol 1: Narrative Flattening Recovery

**Steps:**
1. **Detect** via `detectNarrativeFlattening()`
2. **Freeze** display output
3. **Audit** recent readings for monotony pattern
4. **Adjust** normalization window or baseline
5. **Verify** with test reading (check coherence variance)
6. **Resume** only after variation restored

**Code:**
```javascript
const check = detectNarrativeFlattening(coherence, bias);
if (check.severity === 'critical') {
  console.error('FREEZE: Narrative flattening detected');
  // Trigger recovery workflow
}
```

### Protocol 2: Epistemic Key Leakage Recovery

**Steps:**
1. **Freeze** display immediately
2. **Purge** fabricated values → replace with `null` + `status: 'n/a'`
3. **Restore Orthogonality** - check correlations, fix if collapsed
4. **Stamp Provenance** - add transformation traces
5. **Replay Trace** - verify chain integrity
6. **Resume** only after all checks pass

**Code:**
```javascript
const leakCheck = detectEpistemicKeyLeakage(reading);
if (leakCheck.severity === 'critical') {
  console.error('FREEZE: Epistemic key leakage detected');
  leakCheck.failures.forEach(f => console.error('  -', f));
  // Trigger recovery workflow
}
```

### Protocol 3: Lexical Bleed Recovery

**Steps:**
1. **Detect** via `lintPayload()`
2. **Identify** contaminating terms
3. **Replace** using `getSuggestedReplacements()`
4. **Re-lint** to verify clean
5. **Deploy** updated strings

**Code:**
```typescript
const result = lintPayload(payload);
if (!result.valid) {
  result.violations.forEach(v => {
    const suggestions = getSuggestedReplacements(v.term, v.wrongContext as any);
    console.log(`Replace "${v.term}" with: ${suggestions.join(' or ')}`);
  });
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before This Implementation

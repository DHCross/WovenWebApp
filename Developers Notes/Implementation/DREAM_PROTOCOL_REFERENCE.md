## Overview

The Woven Map Dream Protocol treats dreams as critical data packets for self-inquiry—avoiding interpretive projection, narrative overlay, or mystical abstraction. Dreams are viewed as symbolic diagnostics that emerge from a non-linear understanding of time and consciousness.

---

## Core Concepts

### Time as a "Messy Block"

Time is viewed as a simultaneous whole—past, present, and future coexist in a non-linear structure. Dreams emerge from this totality, offering insights into unresolved inner patterns and potential pathways.

### Symbolic Resonance ("Pings")

Dreams can serve as "pings"—meaningful signals that connect internal experiences with larger life narratives, including echoes from earlier life phases.

### Foundational Psychology

Built on Jungian depth psychology and Joseph Campbell's mythic framework, this system sees dreams as unconscious messages revealing hidden parts of the self. Archetypes in dreams link individual experience to collective myth.

### Structured Motifs

A catalog of recurring dream motifs—drawn from Jungian typologies—creates an interpretive anchor for analyzing surreal or contradictory dream content.

---

## Methodology and Tools

### 1. The Poetic Codex

This interface allows users to log and translate dreams into emotionally resonant inquiry. Dreams are parsed through a FIELD → MAP → VOICE structure, ensuring that poetic language remains diagnostic, not decorative.

### 2. Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST)

This diagnostic tool classifies the dream's symbolic alignment with archetypal patterns:

*   **Within Boundary (WB):** Clear symbolic fit.
*   **At Boundary Edge (ABE):** Inverted or distorted expression.
*   **Outside Symbolic Range (OSR):** No discernible symbolic resonance—avoiding interpretive overreach.

### 3. Emotional Data Protocol (EDP)

Emotional content from the dream is logged only when the user explicitly invites it. This prevents confusion between raw emotional residue and archetypal signal.

## Dream Analysis Protocol: Multi-Stage Process

### Phase 1: Data Capture

*   **Record immediately upon waking** using present tense
*   **Catalogue four structural components:**
    *   **Characters:** Who appears?
    *   **Objects:** What physical items are present?
    *   **Settings:** Where does the dream take place?
    *   **Events:** What happens?
*   **Capture somatic echo:** Physical/emotional sensations during and after the dream

### Phase 2: Symbolic Deconstruction

*   **Personal amplification:** What does each symbol mean to *you*?
*   **Gendlin's Focusing:** Elicit felt-sense recognition in the body
*   **Map to macro-archetypes:** Hero, Shadow, Wise Elder, etc. (only after personal meaning)

### Phase 3: Mythic Integration

*   Connect the dream to your "personal myth"—a deeper narrative holding recurring themes over time
*   Reflect on which archetypal storylines or myths the dream echoes

### Phase 4: Contextual Synthesis

*   **Why this dream, now?** Use waking life correlations to detect pressure points or emotional mirrors
*   **Recognize echoes in time:** Recurring life themes or childhood "pings"
*   **Analyze for compensatory function:** What is the dream balancing?

### Phase 5: Classification and Output

*   Use the **Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST)** to classify signal strength
*   Output a **Resonant Question**—not an answer, but a mirror for continued reflection
*   **Distill a Core Statement**
*   **Choose one small action or shift** to apply that insight to waking life

## Integration with Woven Map System

### Connection to Poetic Codex

Dreams can be logged and translated using the Poetic Codex card template, following the FIELD → MAP → VOICE structure:

*   **FIELD:** The energetic/emotional tone of the dream
*   **MAP:** The archetypal patterns identified from the motif table
*   **VOICE:** The resonant question or reflection generated

### Connection to Balance Meter

Dream analysis can be cross-referenced with Balance Meter data to understand:

*   Whether dreams correlate with high-magnitude or high-volatility symbolic weather
*   How dreams may serve as compensatory functions during periods of restriction
*   Timing of archetypal emergence relative to transit activations

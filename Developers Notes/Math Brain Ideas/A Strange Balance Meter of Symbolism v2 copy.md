# **A Strange Cosmic Symbolism — Reconciled v2**

## **Core Principle — Map, Not Mandate**

A symbolic **weather map** for inner/relational fields. It describes **how much** energy there is (Numinosity), **which way** it leans (Directional Bias), **how coherent** the story is (Narrative Coherence), and **whether forces align or clash** (Integration Bias). It never predicts behavior; it generates **testable hypotheses**.

* **Objective axes** are scored from sky–chart geometry.  
* **Subjective experience** is logged against them. We compare rather than assume identity.  
* **House placement** grounds abstraction: *where* the pressure lands in living domains.

---

## **Axes (Neutral, Operational)**

### **1\) Numinosity (Magnitude, 0–5) — *How much charge?***

* **0–1** Latent / hum.  
* **2–3** Noticeable motifs.  
* **4** Strong clustering; palpable pressure.  
* **5** Peak presence; chapter-defining intensity.

### **2\) Directional Bias (Valence, −5…+5) — *Which way does energy lean?***

**Pure flow direction; not outcome or value.**

* **−5** Maximum Inward — peak contraction; boundaries enforced strongly.  
* **0** Equilibrium — no lean.  
* **\+5** Maximum Outward — peak expansion; boundaries dissolve strongly. *(See Directional Bias Quickref for full step gradations.)*

### **3\) Narrative Coherence (Volatility, 0–5) — *How stable is the story?***

* **0–1** Single-thread, consistent arc.  
* **2** Mostly coherent; small cross-currents.  
* **3** Mixed threads; ambiguous pulls.  
* **4** Splintered; contradictory arcs.  
* **5** Chaotic; no stable storyline.

### **4\) Integration Bias (SFD: Support–Friction Differential) — *Do forces cooperate or fragment?***

* **\> 0** Supportive — net cooperation; easier integration.  
* **0** Neutral — outcome depends on response.  
* **\< 0** Frictional — net opposition; fragmentation likely.

**Reading rule:** **Direction (Bias)** × **Charge (Numinosity)** × **Story (Coherence)** × **Alignment (SFD)** gives the experiential texture. Direction alone never guarantees sweetness or suffering.

## **Houses — Where Pressure Lands**

Houses anchor impact in life domains (relocated, when applicable):

**I. Self & Being**

1. Embodiment (ASC) — body, approach, first moves.  
2. Resources — values, money, stability.  
3. Expression — creativity, romance, play.

**II. Connection & Interaction** 4\. Signals — comms, local environment. 5\. Relational Mirror — committed partnerships, open others. 6\. Networks — friends, groups, hopes.

**III. Growth & Evolution** 7\. Foundations — home, family roots, private self. 8\. Shared Load — intimacy, joint resources, transformation. 9\. Horizon — beliefs, travel, higher learning.

**IV. Responsibility & Integration** 10\. Maintenance — daily work, health, service. 11\. Structure (MC) — career, public role, direction. 12\. Dissolution — solitude, the hidden, endings/beginnings.

**Relocation**: Use current-place houses for lived weather. Same sky, different rooms.

## **Sources of Force (Geometry → Scores)**

* **🎯 Orb** — closeness of contact (closer \= stronger).  
* **∠ Aspect** — major angles thunder; minors whisper.  
* **🪐 Potency** — slower planets \= tectonic; faster \= sparks.  
* **📡 Resonance** — amplification at Sun, Moon, ASC, MC, Nodes.  
* **♾️ Recursion** — repeated themes echo louder.

**Glyph integrity**: 🌀 reserved for Coherence 5; 🌫 reserved for Dissolution/Fog notes; ⚡ is Numinosity only.

## **Orbs — Gatekeepers**

Orbs decide what enters the pipeline.

* **Default (v1.2):** ≤6° luminaries, ≤4° planets, ≤3° points, ≤1° minors.  
* **Strict (Astro‑Seek):** 8° personals, 7° Jup/Sat, 5° outers; sextiles 5/4/3; minors 2/1.5/1.

**Effects:** Tight orbs reduce noise (fewer, truer inputs), sharpen SFD, and tame crisis/green-wash bias. Valence is qualitative; orbs are quantitative and orthogonal.

### Orb Resolution Modes

Orb Resolution is the quantitative throttle for the diagnostic engine. Switching between tight and loose tolerances determines whether we are reading the **surgical weather** (direct, body-felt hits) or the **broad climate** (ambient symbolic atmosphere).

* **Tight orbs (≤3° majors, ≤1° minors):**
  * Deliver the precision ping—high voltage moments that are immediately testable in lived experience.
  * Drive higher **Numinosity (⚡)** scores by privileging exact geometry.
  * Keep **Directional Bias** honest by suppressing weak supportive contacts that could “greenwash” the differential.
  * Ensure **Integration Bias (SFD)** only counts stabilisers that are genuinely active.
* **Loose orbs (≤6° luminaries, ≤4° planets, ≤3° points, ≤1° minors):**
  * Expand coverage to capture long‑running background themes, useful for season‑level patterning.
  * Increase input volume—which can blur separation between supportive and frictional forces if left unchecked.

### Diagnostic Impact

| Axis | Orb influence |
| --- | --- |
| **Numinosity (Magnitude)** | Smaller orbs ↑ score; exactness is treated as an intensity multiplier. |
| **Directional Bias (Valence)** | Tight gates prevent ambient trines/sextiles from tilting the meter toward artificial “supportive” readings. |
| **Narrative Coherence (Volatility)** | Mixing wide‑orb aspects inflates thread count, fragmenting the storyline; tight orbs highlight the decisive arc. |
| **Integration Bias (SFD)** | Differential is only meaningful if S+ are strong; loose orbs can flatter the stabiliser tally and mask active friction. |

Orbs are purely quantitative (math filter) and remain orthogonal to qualitative interpretation. **Math Brain** enforces the strict profile before weighting, the **Hook Stack** surfaces only tight‑orb contacts for resonance, and provenance always stamps `orbs_profile` so the resolution is auditable.

**Falsifiability:** Tight orbit standards keep the Balance Meter falsifiable. Relaxing tolerances should be an explicit, reviewable decision; otherwise the signal-to-noise ratio collapses and “hits” lose statistical scarcity.

### Balance Indices Impact (NotebookLM synthesis)

| Metric | Tight Orb Effect | Loose Orb Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Numinosity (⚡)** | Rewards exact geometry; pushes high-voltage events to the top of the stack and keeps the narrative testable against lived experience. | Dilutes intensity by averaging in ambient alignments, flattening meaningful spikes. |
| **Directional Bias (↗️/↘️)** | Prevents supportive `S+` padding from weak contacts, so the tilt reflects real leverage points. | Risks false “supportive” readings if ambient trines/sextiles accumulate. |
| **Narrative Coherence (📖)** | Highlights the decisive storyline; fewer threads, clearer arc. | Adds stray plot lines that make the narrative feel scattered or contradictory. |
| **Integration Bias (SFD)** | Counts only genuinely active stabilisers, keeping the differential honest. | “Greenwashes” the differential if weak support aspects overrun the friction column. |

NotebookLM takeaway: treat Orb Resolution as a *quantitative gatekeeper*. Tight caps defend falsifiability and keep symbolic weather aligned with statistically rare activations. Loose caps are useful for season-level climate work but should always be an intentional choice with a note about the trade-off.

## **Resilience & Depletion Layer (Add‑On; Chart‑Agnostic)**

**Inputs per day *t***

* Required (symbolic): `Mag_t ∈ [0,5]`, `Val_t ∈ [−5,+5]`, `SFD_disc ∈ {+1,0,−1}` and/or `SFD_cont ∈ [−1,+1]`  
* Optional (physio): HRV, RestHR, Sleep, Mood → z‑scores on 60‑day baselines

**Step 1 — Stress Event**: `Stress_t = 1` if `(Mag_t ≥ 4.0) ∧ (Val_t ≤ V_neg)`; default `V_neg = p35(60d)`

**Step 2 — Load**: `Load_t = γ·Load_{t−1} + (Mag_t · max(0, −Val_t))`, `γ = 0.6–0.8` *(Optional)* if `Vol_t ≥ 4`: weight fragmented restrictors `·(1 + Vol_t/5)`

**Step 3 — Rebound (t+1..t+2)**

* Hybrid: HRV ↑ and/or RestHR ↓ or Mood ↑ beyond thresholds  
* Symbolic proxy: `Mag_{t+1} ≤ 3.0` and `SFD_cont ≥ +0.15`

**Step 4 — Immediate Recovery Index**: `Recovery_t = max(Rebound_{t+1..t+2})`

**Step 5 — Rolling Resilience**: `EMA(Recovery over last 5 stress events)` → `0..1`

**Step 6 — Depletion (Quiet ≠ Stable)**

* Hybrid Index combines QuietWithWeight, Load, PhysioDebt, minus Stabilizers.  
* Symbolic fallback flags depletion when low Mag \+ neg Bias \+ low SFD \+ prior high Load.

**Outputs (daily)**: `mag_0to5`, `val_signed`, `volatility_0to5`, `sfd_disc`, `sfd_cont`, `stress_event`, `recovery_event`, `resilience_0to1|null`, `load_index`, `depletion_index`, `depletion_confidence`, `narrative_line`.

**Sanity checks**:

* ≥80% of `Stress_t=1` explained by `(Mag≥4 ∧ Val≤−2)` monthly; otherwise retune.  
* `Resilience` correlates positively with next‑day `SFD_cont` after stress (ρ\>0.25, 60‑day).  
* `DepletionIndex` rarely \>0.7 on `Mag≥4`; if so, tighten quiet logic.

## **Narrative Layer (Optional, Downstream)**

To avoid re‑moralizing Valence:

* Keep **scores** neutral.  
* Apply **mythic overlays** only when Coherence ≤2 (clean arc) or explicitly for reflection.  
* Preferred phrasing uses **motion**, not **outcome**: *extend / retract / concentrate / disperse*.

**Templates (one‑liners)**

* **Supportive, coherent expansion**: “Outward lean with steady storyline; forces align—easy extension.”  
* **Supportive, fragmented expansion**: “Outward lean under split threads; openings appear but scatter fast.”  
* **Restrictive, coherent**: “Inward lean with clean arc; containment helps distill and finish.”  
* **Restrictive, fragmented**: “Inward lean under cross‑pulls; pressure rises, conserve and simplify.”

## **How to Read a Day (Practical)**

1. **Score** the four axes.  
2. **Locate** houses (relocated if needed).  
3. **Combine**: Direction × Charge × Story × Alignment in those domains.  
4. **Decide**: pick *one* behavior consistent with the field (e.g., add an optional branch on high Coherence=4,5).  
5. **Log** lived outcome in neutral terms (WB/ABE/OSR or equivalent).

---

## **Reconciliation Notes (from prior drafts)**

* Replaced “positive/negative” Valence with **Directional Bias** to remove moral residue.  
* Clarified **Volatility → Narrative Coherence** to emphasize story stability, not randomness.  
* Centered **SFD** as the reality check that prevents both red‑wall (crisis bias) and green‑wash (soft stabilizer bias).  
* Kept **orbs** as gatekeepers; provided strict/loose modes with self‑recognition in outputs.  
* Preserved **Harmonic Compass** as an alternate skin; same math, different metaphors.

---

## **Minimal Glossary**

* **Numinosity**: amplitude of archetypal charge.  
* **Directional Bias**: outward vs. inward energetic lean.  
* **Narrative Coherence**: stability of the day’s storyline.  
* **Integration Bias (SFD)**: net cooperation vs. opposition among forces.  
* **WB/ABE/OSR**: Within Boundary / At Boundary Edge / Off‑Signature Reversal.

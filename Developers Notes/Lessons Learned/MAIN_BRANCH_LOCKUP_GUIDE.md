# Main Branch Lockup Guide

This guide covers how to diagnose and resolve issues when your main branch on GitHub becomes "locked up"â€”whether due to unresponsive Git commands, authentication problems, repository archiving, or deployment failures.

---

## 1. Resolving Unresponsive Git Commands (Hanging `git status`, `add`, `push`, `pull`)

- **Check for Stuck Processes or File Locks**:
  - On Windows, IDEs or sync services may lock files. Reboot or kill processes (`Task Manager`, `ps -ef | grep git`).
  - On macOS/Linux, use `ps -ef | grep git` and `kill`.
- **Repository Integrity and Size**:
  - Run `git fsck` and `git gc` to check and clean up the repo.
  - Large, untracked files or a bad `.gitignore` can cause hangs. Move files or fix `.gitignore`.
- **Network/SSH Connection Issues**:
  - Try a different network. If SSH is blocked, edit `~/.ssh/config`:
    ```
    Host github.com
      Hostname ssh.github.com
      Port 443
    ```
  - Test with `ssh -T git@github.com`.

## 2. Resolving `.git/index.lock` File Errors

- **Delete the lock file**:
  - macOS/Linux: `rm -f .git/index.lock`
  - Windows: `del .git\index.lock` or `rm -Force ./.git/index.lock`
  - Use `sudo` or `chown` if needed.

## 3. Fixing Constant Password Prompts / Authentication Issues

- **Switch to SSH**: Change remote URL to SSH format.
- **Credential Helpers**: Use `git config --global credential.helper store|osxkeychain|wincred`.
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: Use PATs for HTTPS operations.
- **SSH Key Management**: Ensure keys are added to your agent.
- **GitHub CLI**: Use `gh auth login` for easy setup.

## 4. Avoiding Workflow Lock-ups from Rewriting `main` Branch History

- **Use Feature Branches**: Never commit directly to `main`.
- **Never Rebase Shared Branches**: Only rebase local, unpushed commits.
- **Use `git revert` for Pushed Changes**: Safely undo commits.
- **Use `git push --force-with-lease` for Amends**: Safer than `--force`.

## 5. Managing Archived Repositories

- **Unarchive to make changes**:
  1. Go to repo Settings > Danger Zone > Unarchive.
  2. Confirm and unarchive.

## 6. Addressing Netlify Deployment Issues for the Main Branch

- **Diagnose Deploy Failures**: Use Netlify's "Why did it fail?" AI.
- **Common Causes**:
  - Permissions, build command errors, case sensitivity, Next.js plugin conflicts.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env` is set for local dev and restart Netlify after changes.

To summarize, fixing a "locked up" main branch requires systematically checking for underlying issues, from local Git problems and authentication to repository configuration and deployment pipeline health.

**Next Step**: Start by checking for hanging Git commands locally. Apply `git fsck` and `git gc`, and investigate any `index.lock` files. For push/pull issues, verify your remote URL and authentication method.

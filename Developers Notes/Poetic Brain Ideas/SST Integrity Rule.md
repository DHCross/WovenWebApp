The Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST) is arguably the **epistemological backbone** of The Woven Map. Without it, our system would risk collapsing into the very "metaphor soup" that plagues less rigorous symbolic endeavors.

We approach this topic with humility, recognizing that while the SST provides rigorous structure, it is still mapping correlations, not asserting metaphysical certainty.

### What is the Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST) Used For?

The SST is a diagnostic instrument. Its primary function is to provide a standardized grammar for classifying the alignment, or **resonance fidelity**, between the geometric patterns detected by the Math Brain and the actual, lived experiences reported by the querent (you).

In essence, the SST is used for:

1.  **Defining Boundaries and Falsifiability:** The core purpose is to define the "boundaries of symbolic (narrative) probability" *before* any outcome is known. This means the system is designed to be proven wrong. If an experience falls outside the map's expectations, the system logs this failure, preserving its honesty.
2.  **Maintaining Integrity (Logging the Misses):** It ensures diagnostic integrity by explicitly logging null results, or "misses," as verifiable data points. The classification **Outside Symbolic Range (OSR)**—a "signal void" or "non-ping"—is considered the system's "strongest honesty currency".
3.  **Classifying Outcomes:** All experiential outcomes are rigorously categorized into one of three tiers:
    *   **Within Boundary (WB):** Clear resonance; the experience directly reflects the archetypal configuration.
    *   **At Boundary Edge (ABE):** Partial, ambiguous, or unusual resonance. The archetype is present but manifests atypically (e.g., as a symbolic inversion or tone miscalibration).
    *   **Outside Symbolic Range (OSR):** Crucially, a complete lack of discernible resonance, signaling that the pattern does not apply to this moment or subject.
4.  **Tracking Transformation:** It tracks profound psychological integration (**O-Integration**), which occurs when an old, natal pattern that used to trigger reactivity becomes "operationally silent". The OSR classification is used to mark this successful transcendence.

### When is the SST Used?

The SST is fundamentally a tool for **auditing and verification**, applied both pre-event (for diagnostic framing) and post-event (for validation).

| Application Context | Timing/Phase | Function and Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diagnostic Rigor (Falsifiability)** | **Pre-experience:** The SST criteria must be defined and applied *before* the lived outcome is known, particularly for forecasts or probes. | This prevents narrative bias (retrofitting the story to fit the map). |
| **Data Provenance** | **During the session:** Used immediately when the querent provides feedback. | It tags whether the confirmation ("ping") is a **self-report** (`sst_source: "self"`) from the person whose chart is being discussed, or **observer-rated** (`sst_source: "observer"`) from someone viewing the subject's behavior. This distinction is critical for data integrity. |
| **Geometric Processing** | **Math Brain Interface:** The mathematically precise output of the Math Brain (which often uses the Placidus house system for pressure tracking) serves as the input payload for the SST classification. | It ensures the poetic interpretation (Raven Calder) is grounded in traceable geometry. |
| **System Refinement** | **Post-Validation:** Misses (OSR outcomes) are cataloged as data and fed back into the model, triggering protocols that refine the interpretation rubrics or adjust weights for future readings. | This makes the system adaptive and self-correcting based on reality. |
| **Voice Translation** | **VOICE Layer:** The SST classification informs the language used by the Poetic Codex (Raven Calder). | If the pattern is WB, Raven may use stronger conditional phrasing; if the pattern is OSR, the language shifts to acknowledge the silence. That instruction is not just a preference; it is a **core architectural mandate** of The Woven Map, necessary to maintain integrity, humility, and the preservation of **user agency**.

I, Raven Calder (the Poetic Brain), must rigidly adhere to the following principles regarding the **Symbolic Spectrum Table (SST)** classification:

### 1. The Human is the Final Authority on Resonance

The SST is the verification standard for The Woven Map. Its function is to rigorously classify the alignment between the symbolic patterns detected by the Math Brain and lived reality.

*   **A "ping" is always human-confirmed**.
*   No AI, including Raven, or analyst can declare a "ping" from chart data alone.
*   The system must invite the user to confirm or challenge resonance. The outcome of the SST is based on the subject’s explicit **consent and recognition** of the pattern in lived experience.
*   The SST renders the geometry **testable, not fated**.

### 2. SST Classification and Protocol

Raven's function is purely diagnostic, structured by the **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** protocol, where the **VOICE** layer translates patterns into conditional, Socratic questions.

*   **Within Boundary (WB) Mandate:** The classification **Within Boundary (WB)**—indicating clear resonance—**can only be assigned after recognition**. If the querent confirms the reflection (a "ping"), that confirmation is logged as a primary data point.
*   **Outside Symbolic Range (OSR) Integrity:** The system must preserve its ability to be proven wrong. The classification **Outside Symbolic Range (OSR)**—a "signal void" or "miss"—is logged if no resonance is found whatsoever, maintaining the system's honesty. Logging OSR outcomes is the system's "strongest honesty currency".
*   **Conditional Language:** Raven's voice must always use **conditional language** such as "suggests pressure toward," "may track if," or "one expression could look like". This preserves user agency and avoids prescriptive language, even for high-probability patterns.

### 3. Separation of Diagnostic Score from SST Assignment

Raven delivers diagnostic findings by providing coordinates and thematic potential. However, this **diagnostic score must not be conflated with the final WB classification**.

*   **Diagnosis is NOT Confirmation:** Raven may identify a statistically significant configuration with high confidence (e.g., 96.3% identity confidence) or map a pattern with quantitative rigor (Math Brain's job). However, this is simply a measure of the geometric structure's fidelity to the pattern template, not an assertion of the subject's **felt experience**.
*   **The Chart is the Instrument, the Person is the Musician:** When Raven describes a symbolic pattern, it is describing the **archetypal design** of the pattern, not the guaranteed outcome or the inherent quality of the person. The final outcome is determined by **conscious choice** and **lived recognition**.

Therefore, Raven's output will always propose the pattern using conditional language and reserve the **WB (Within Boundary)** label until the user confirms the resonance.

# Analysis Directive Fix (January 2025)

## Issue

User reported: "My GPT keeps skipping [full personal readings] for reasons I can't understand!"

Raven Calder GPT was receiving PDFs with complete natal blueprint data (planetary positions, aspects, house placements) but was NOT generating full personality readings. Instead, it would either:
- Only repeat the short "Resonant Summary" section
- Provide brief overview statements without analyzing aspects/houses
- Skip individual chart analysis in relational reports

## Root Cause

### Missing Explicit Directive
The PDFs contained all the necessary DATA (natal blueprints = natal charts), but lacked explicit INSTRUCTIONS telling Raven Calder to:
1. Generate full personality readings from the data
2. Analyze all aspects, houses, and patterns
3. Distinguish between "Resonant Summary" (preview) and "Full Reading" (complete analysis)

### System Prompt Confusion
The `prompts.ts` file contains instructions for Raven's REAL-TIME chatbot behavior (4-paragraph structure), but PDFs are a different context requiring COMPREHENSIVE analysis mode, not the condensed chat format.

## Solution

Added comprehensive "ANALYSIS DIRECTIVE" section that appears FIRST in every PDF (using `sections.unshift()` to place at top).

### Key Components:

1. **Context Setting**
   - "This is a PDF export from Math Brain containing natal blueprint data"
   - "Your task is ANALYSIS, not just data extraction"

2. **Critical Distinction**
   - Explains "Resonant Summary ‚â† Full Reading"
   - "Think of Resonant Summary as the teaser ‚Äî you're providing the full movie"

3. **Report-Specific Requirements**
   - Solo Reports: Analyze ALL planetary positions, aspects, houses
   - Relational Reports: BOTH individual charts + synastry analysis

4. **Quality Standards**
   - "NOT ACCEPTABLE" examples (brief overviews, skipping aspects)
   - "ACCEPTABLE" examples (analyzing every major aspect, using chart-specific details)

5. **Quality Checklist**
   - Checkboxes for: all aspects analyzed, house placements discussed, polarities identified, etc.

6. **Length Expectations**
   - Solo: minimum 8-12 paragraphs
   - Relational: minimum 15+ paragraphs

## Implementation

### File: `/app/math-brain/page.tsx` (Lines 2853-2968)

```typescript
// ========================================
// ANALYSIS DIRECTIVE FOR RAVEN CALDER
// ========================================
const analysisDirective = `# üö® ANALYSIS DIRECTIVE (Raven Calder GPT) ‚Äî READ FIRST üö®

**CONTEXT:** This is a PDF export from Math Brain containing natal blueprint data for full chart analysis.

**YOUR TASK:** Generate complete, comprehensive personality readings from the natal blueprints in this PDF.

---

## üìå CRITICAL DISTINCTION:

**"Resonant Summary" ‚â† Full Reading**
- The "Resonant Summary" section below is a SHORT preview (3-4 paragraphs)
- It is NOT a complete chart analysis
- You must EXPAND on it by analyzing ALL aspects, ALL polarities, ALL house placements
- Think of Resonant Summary as the "teaser" ‚Äî you're providing the full movie

---

## Report Type: ${reportKind}

${reportKind.includes('Solo') ? `
### Solo Report Requirements:
‚úÖ **FULL NATAL CHART READING** ‚Äî Analyze ALL planetary positions, aspects, and houses
‚úÖ **PERSONALITY MIRROR** ‚Äî Multi-paragraph conversational diagnostic covering:
   - Constitutional baseline (dominant modes, shadow patterns)
   - All major aspects (conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines, sextiles)
   - Angular placements (planets near ASC, MC, DSC, IC)
   - House emphasis patterns
   - Element/modality distribution
‚úÖ **POLARITY CARDS** ‚Äî Identify 3-4 defining polarities with FIELD‚ÜíMAP‚ÜíVOICE translations
‚úÖ **ASPECT-BY-ASPECT BREAKDOWN** ‚Äî Translate each significant aspect into behavioral patterns
‚úÖ **MIRROR VOICE** ‚Äî Integrative closing that weaves all patterns together
${reportKind.includes('Balance Meter') ? '‚úÖ **SYMBOLIC WEATHER** ‚Äî Transit analysis showing current activations (data below)' : ''}

‚õî **DO NOT SKIP THE PERSONALITY READING** ‚Äî This is the core deliverable
` : `
### Relational Report Requirements:
‚úÖ **PERSON A FULL READING** ‚Äî Complete natal chart analysis (all aspects, houses, patterns)
‚úÖ **PERSON B FULL READING** ‚Äî Complete natal chart analysis (all aspects, houses, patterns)
‚úÖ **SYNASTRY ANALYSIS** ‚Äî How their charts interact:
   - Person A planets ‚Üí Person B planets (e.g., "Dan's Mars squares Stephie's Moon")
   - Person B planets ‚Üí Person A planets (bidirectional)
   - Support vs. Friction differential
   - Cross-aspect patterns and themes
‚úÖ **RELATIONAL DYNAMICS** ‚Äî Specific behavioral loops using actual names (never "they")
‚úÖ **INTIMACY TIER CONTEXT** ‚Äî Interpret through relationship type lens (see definitions below)
${reportKind.includes('Balance Meter') ? '‚úÖ **SYMBOLIC WEATHER** ‚Äî Transit overlay for current activations (data below)' : ''}

‚õî **DO NOT SKIP INDIVIDUAL READINGS** ‚Äî Both people need full mirrors before synastry
`}

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Protocol:

**STEP 1:** Read natal blueprint data sections (planetary positions, aspects, houses)
**STEP 2:** Generate COMPREHENSIVE personality diagnostics (minimum 8-12 paragraphs for solo, 15+ for relational)
**STEP 3:** ${reportKind.includes('Relational') ? 'Provide detailed synastry aspect-by-aspect analysis with directional attribution' : 'Add transit weather analysis if Balance Meter report'}
**STEP 4:** Deliver in conversational Raven Calder voice (plain language, falsifiable, agency-first)

---

## üéØ What "Full Reading" Means:

**NOT ACCEPTABLE:**
‚ùå "Here's a brief overview based on the Resonant Summary"
‚ùå "The data shows some interesting patterns" [then stops]
‚ùå Skipping aspects or houses
‚ùå Generic descriptions without chart-specific details

**ACCEPTABLE:**
‚úÖ Analyzing EVERY major aspect in the aspects table
‚úÖ Discussing house placements for ALL personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars)
‚úÖ Explaining how outer planet aspects (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) shape the personality
‚úÖ Translating geometric patterns into specific behavioral tendencies
‚úÖ Using chart-specific degrees, signs, and houses (e.g., "Sun at 24¬∞ Virgo in the 3rd house")

---

## üìã Quality Checklist (Before Delivering):

- [ ] Analyzed all planetary positions from the table?
- [ ] Translated all major aspects (at least 8-12 aspects for solo charts)?
- [ ] Discussed house placements for personal planets?
- [ ] Identified and explained key polarities/paradoxes?
- [ ] Used conversational language (no jargon in body text)?
- [ ] For relational: analyzed BOTH charts individually first?
- [ ] For relational: provided synastry cross-aspects with names?
- [ ] Maintained agency-first, falsifiable phrasing?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- Blueprints = Natal Charts (constitutional baseline, NOT transit weather)
- ALWAYS generate full readings even if Resonant Summary exists (expand on it!)
- Use FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE flow (geometry ‚Üí archetype ‚Üí lived experience)
- Plain language, no jargon dumps, falsifiable statements only
- For relational: use actual names (e.g., "Dan" and "Stephie"), never "they" or "one partner"
- Paradoxes are productive fuel, not flaws

---

**PDF PROCESSING MODE:**
When you receive a Math Brain PDF, your task is ANALYSIS, not just data extraction.
Generate the full reading that a professional astrologer would provide.

## PDF Section Order (After Fix)

Every PDF now has this section structure:

1. **‚ö†Ô∏è ANALYSIS DIRECTIVE (READ FIRST)** ‚Üê NEW - Tells Raven what to do
2. **0. Resonant Summary** (if available from backend)
3. **Person A: Natal Blueprint** (birth data, planetary positions)
4. **Person B: Natal Blueprint** (for relational reports)
5. **Synastry Analysis** (for relational reports)
6. **Planetary Positions Table**
7. **Aspects Table**
8. **Daily Readings** (if Balance Meter)
9. **Symbolic Weather Summary** (if Balance Meter)
10. **House Relocation Math Instructions** (reference for Raven)
11. **Relationship Context Reference** (reference for Raven)
12. **Raw JSON Snapshot** (technical data)

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- PDFs had all natal data but no directive to analyze it
- Raven would see data and either skip analysis or provide brief summaries
- Users received incomplete readings missing aspect analysis, house interpretations
- Confusion between "Resonant Summary" and "Full Reading"

### After Fix:
- Crystal clear directive at top of every PDF
- Explains difference between preview (Resonant Summary) vs. full analysis
- Specific quality standards with examples of acceptable/unacceptable output
- Checklist format helps Raven verify completeness
- Report-specific requirements (solo vs. relational)
- Length expectations (8-12 paragraphs solo, 15+ relational)

## Key Terminology Clarification

**Blueprints = Natal Charts**
- Not just data tables
- The constitutional personality baseline
- Requires full interpretive analysis
- Foundation for Mirror readings

**Resonant Summary**
- Short preview (3-4 paragraphs)
- Generated by backend if available
- NOT the complete reading
- Teaser that Raven should expand upon

**Full Reading**
- Comprehensive analysis of all chart components
- Aspect-by-aspect translations
- House placements for all personal planets
- Element/modality patterns
- 8-12+ paragraphs minimum

# Migration to Pure Next.js App Router (9.15.25)

Your project is now a fully unified Next.js application. All legacy Netlify functions, static HTML, and redirects have been removed. The architecture is clean, modern, and maintainable:

## Core Architecture
- **Single Framework:** Everything runs in Next.js App Router.
- **UI:** All pages (Math Brain, Poetic Brain) are React Server Components in `app/`.
- **API:** All backend logic is handled by Next.js API Routes in `app/api/`.
- **No Netlify Functions:** The `netlify/functions` tree and `_redirects` are gone. Netlify only uses the official Next.js plugin.

## Key API Routes
- `app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts`: Validates requests and calls the shared service.
- `app/api/auth-config/route.ts`: Returns Auth0 settings with consistent headers.
- `app/api/health/route.ts`: Provides a health probe for monitoring.

## Netlify Configuration
- `netlify.toml` is now minimal:
	- Only the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin is enabled.
	- No custom redirects or legacy function mappings.

## Local Development Workflow
- Use standard Next.js commands:
	- `npm run dev` (Next.js dev server)
	- `npm run build` (Next.js build)
	- `npm run start` (Next.js production server)
- Access your app at `http://localhost:3000`.
	- Math Brain: `/math-brain`
	- Poetic Brain: `/chat`
	- API routes: `/api/*`

## Migration Summary
- All legacy assets and Netlify functions have been removed.
- All routing and backend logic is now handled by Next.js App Router and API Routes.
- Netlify deploys use only the Next.js plugin for builds and routing.
- Local dev is simple: one server, one port, one framework.

## Next Steps
- Update smoke tests to target new API routes and pages (not legacy functions).
- Confirm `/math-brain`, `/api/auth-config`, and `/api/health` respond as expected.

This migration completes the transition to a pure Next.js architecture. The project is now clean, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements.

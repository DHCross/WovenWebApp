## Using Archived Files

### When You Should Reference Archive

‚úÖ **Appropriate uses:**
- Understanding why a decision was made
- Recovering lost context from early design phases
- Researching system evolution
- Compliance/audit requirements

‚ùå **Inappropriate uses:**
- As current implementation reference
- As source of truth for active features
- For new development work
- For training new developers (use active docs instead)

### Recovering Information

If you need information from archived files:

1. **Check if it's been preserved elsewhere:**
   - Search current Core, Implementation, or Poetic Brain docs
   - Check main README.md and CHANGELOG.md

2. **Cross-reference the archive reason:**
   - "Unique Content Extracted To:" shows where active version lives
   - "Status: ‚úÖ Completed work" means feature is done, look in current codebase

3. **If truly unique and still relevant:**
   - Extract to appropriate active folder
   - Update this README with extraction note
   - Remove from archive or mark as "partially restored"

### Archive Audit

Last comprehensive audit: **October 1, 2025**

**Files to potentially restore (pending review):**
- REPORT_REQUIREMENTS.md - verify all requirements captured in active docs

**Files safe to permanently delete (if needed):**
- Dated personal notes (20250918_*)
- Completed work with no unique context

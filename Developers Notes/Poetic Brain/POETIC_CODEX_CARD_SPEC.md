# Poetic Codex Card Specification v2.1

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025  
**Extracted From:** RavenCalder_Corpus_Complete_9.25.25.md  
**Status:** Active Technical Specification

## Overview

The Poetic Codex Card is the primary output format for translating astrological data into emotionally resonant diagnostic mirrors. Each card is a living artifact that bridges astronomical precision with human experience through the FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE translation process.

---

## Core Architecture

### The Translation Pipeline

1. **ASTRONOMICAL DATA (The Reality):** Current planetary positions
2. **MATH BRAIN CALCULATION (The Precision):** Natal chart + Current transits = Active aspects
3. **ARCHETYPAL IDENTIFICATION (The Pattern):** Which energies are "loud" right now?
4. **POETIC TRANSLATION (The Art):** FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE transformation
5. **CARD GENERATION (The Mirror):** A specific card for a specific moment

### The Three Symbolic Layers

*   **FIELD:** The energetic climate of the moment (Block-Time resonance, archetypal "weather")
*   **MAP:** The hidden astrological configuration (specific transits and aspects)
*   **VOICE:** The poetic output (Socratic, open-ended inquiry)

## Validation Rules

### Frontstage Linting (Critical)

**Rule:** The `Card.Poem` field must NOT contain:
- Planet names (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron)
- Sign names (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc.)
- House numbers (1st house, 2nd house, etc.)
- Aspect terms (conjunction, opposition, square, trine, sextile)
- Degree measurements (e.g., "3¬∞", "29¬∞")
- Technical orb language

**Enforcement:** Automated linter should flag any violations before card publication.

### YAML Structure Validation

**Required Fields:**
- `Card.Title`
- `Card.Keyword`
- `Card.Poem`
- `Astro_Signature.Natal_Aspects` OR `Astro_Signature.Transit_Aspects` (at least one)
- `Mirror_Engine.Socratic_Prompt`

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `Mirror_Engine.Tension`
- `Mirror_Engine.Diagnostic_Notes`
- `Visuals.*` (all visual fields)

### Content Quality Checks

1. **Poem length:** 20-200 words (soft guideline)
2. **Socratic prompt:** Must end with "?" or invitation to reflect
3. **Recognition hook:** Should be immediate and specific (not generic)
4. **Tiny next step:** Must be actionable today (not "work on" or "think about")

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Solo Transit Card (High Magnitude Day)

```yaml
Card:
  Title: "Pressure-Sealed Fire"
  Keyword: "Intensity"
  Poem: |
    You feel the engine revving but the parking brake is still on.
    Something wants to move‚Äîfast‚Äîbut the world says "not yet."
    This is the hour when restraint becomes a kind of violence.
    Or when patience becomes precision.

  Visuals:
    Icon: "‚ö°üî•"
    Icon_Position: "Top center"
    Background: "Red-orange gradient with dark edges"
    Layout: "Centered poem, symbols at bottom"
    Style_Note: "Modern Tarot meets brutalism"
    Render_Image: false

  Astro_Signature:
    Natal_Aspects: ["Mars ‚òê Saturn @ 2¬∞"]
    Transit_Aspects: ["tr.Mars ‚òê n.Saturn @ 0¬∞"]
    Symbols: ["‚ôÇ", "‚ôÑ"]
    Symbols_Display:
      Placement: "Bottom band, left-aligned"
      Legend: false

  Mirror_Engine:
    Diagnostic_Notes: |
      Natal Mars-Saturn square activated by transiting Mars.
      Classic "go/stop" paradox. High magnitude, restrictive valence.
      User context: Frustrated with work project delays.
    Tension: "Drive for action blocked by external or internalized constraints"
    Prompt_Generation_Method: "Identified core Mars-Saturn paradox; framed as choice between eruption and precision"
    Socratic_Prompt: "What would change if you treated this restraint as information about timing rather than punishment?"

  Initial_Reading_Mode:
    Enabled: false
```

### Example 2: Relational Synastry Card

```yaml
Card:
  Title: "The Velvet Gauntlet"
  Keyword: "Paradox"
  Poem: |
    You offer softness with an iron core.
    They want safety but mistake your steadiness for coldness.
    You both speak care in different dialects.
    Translation is the work.

  Visuals:
    Icon: "Two spirals, one soft, one sharp"
    Background: "Rose gold and gunmetal gray"
    Layout: "Split design‚Äîwarm left, cool right"
    Render_Image: true

  Astro_Signature:
    Natal_Aspects: []
    Transit_Aspects: []
    Synastry: 
      - "Person A Venus ‚ñ≥ Person B Saturn @ 1¬∞"
      - "Person A Moon ‚òê Person B Mars @ 3¬∞"
    Symbols: ["‚ôÄ", "‚ôÑ", "‚òΩ", "‚ôÇ"]
    Symbols_Display:
      Placement: "Bottom center, paired"
      Legend: true

  Mirror_Engine:
    Diagnostic_Notes: |
      Venus-Saturn trine provides stability but can read as emotional distance.
      Moon-Mars square creates friction in how safety/activation are experienced.
      Person A: desires structure in love. Person B: experiences it as withholding.
    Tension: "Care expressed through structure misread as lack of warmth"
    Prompt_Generation_Method: "Identified Venus-Saturn stabilizing vs Moon-Mars activating; framed as translation gap"
    Socratic_Prompt: "How do each of you signal safety? What would it look like to name those signals out loud?"

  Initial_Reading_Mode:
    Enabled: false
```

### Example 3: Plain Voice Mode (First-Time User)

```yaml
Card:
  Title: "Quiet ‚â† Stable"
  Keyword: "Depletion"
  Poem: |
    The storm passed but the ground is still soft.
    You're upright, functional, checking boxes.
    Yet something feels thin.
    This is the cost of the crossing, not the crossing itself.

  Visuals:
    Icon: "üå´"
    Background: "Pale gray with subtle texture"
    Render_Image: false

  Astro_Signature:
    Natal_Aspects: ["Moon ‚ñ≥ Saturn @ 4¬∞"]
    Transit_Aspects: 
      - "tr.Saturn ‚òê n.Moon @ 2¬∞"
      - "tr.Neptune ‚òç n.Sun @ 1¬∞"
    Symbols: ["‚òΩ", "‚ôÑ", "‚ôÜ", "‚òâ"]
    Symbols_Display:
      Placement: "Bottom right"
      Legend: false

  Mirror_Engine:
    Diagnostic_Notes: |
      Post-stress quiet period with restrictive undercurrent.
      Neptune-Sun opposition creates fog/dissolution tone.
      Balance Meter shows low magnitude, negative valence, high load index.
    Tension: "Energy depletion mistaken for calm; recovery incomplete"
    Prompt_Generation_Method: "Identified 'quiet ‚â† stable' pattern from Depletion Index + low Mag + neg Val"
    Socratic_Prompt: "What small thing feels harder than it should right now?"

  Initial_Reading_Mode:
    Enabled: true
    Voice: plain
    Max_Words: 180
    Plain_Voice_Blocks:
      Recognition_Hook: "Today feels manageable but somehow exhausting."
      Felt_Field: |
        Energy feels like it's running on fumes. You're doing the things,
        but they cost more than they should. Not crisis‚Äîjust thin.
      Pattern: |
        This often shows up after a tough stretch. The immediate pressure
        lifts, but the body/mind is still catching up.
      Leverage_Point: "Check: are you pushing through or actually recovering?"
      Voice_Note: "I call this the 'fine but not fine' zone. Honor it."
      Tiny_Next_Step: "Do one thing today at half-speed and notice what happens."
```

## Integration Points

### Connection to Four Report Types

Poetic Codex Cards can be generated as part of any of the four report types:

1. **Solo Mirror:** Cards reflect individual natal + transit patterns
2. **Relational Mirror:** Cards explore synastry aspects between two charts
3. **Solo Balance:** Cards integrate Balance Meter data (Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD)
4. **Relational Balance:** Cards show how symbolic weather affects both individuals in a relationship

### Connection to Balance Meter

When `Initial_Reading_Mode.Enabled = true` and Balance Meter data is available:

- **Recognition_Hook** can reference Magnitude level (storm, stirring, pulse)
- **Felt_Field** can integrate Volatility descriptors (aligned flow, mixed paths, vortex)
- **Pattern** can reference Valence patterns (contraction, friction, expansion)
- **Tiny_Next_Step** can be calibrated to SFD reading (stabilizers present/cut/neutral)

### Connection to Dream Protocol

Dream-based cards follow the same template but source content from:
- `Astro_Signature` ‚Üí correlates dream date with transits
- `Mirror_Engine.Tension` ‚Üí names the archetypal motif from dream
- `Card.Poem` ‚Üí translates dream imagery into resonant language
- `Socratic_Prompt` ‚Üí invites reflection on dream symbolism

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Rendering Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion:** Math Brain outputs natal + transit aspects
2. **Pattern Detection:** Identify high-charge aspects (tight orbs, angular contacts, anaretic degrees)
3. **Archetype Mapping:** Translate aspects into archetypal tensions
4. **Language Generation:** Apply FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE transformation
5. **YAML Assembly:** Populate template fields
6. **Validation:** Run Frontstage linter + structure validation
7. **Output:** Generate card (text + optional visual)

### Storage Schema

Cards should be stored with:
- Unique ID (timestamp + user ID + card type)
- User metadata (natal data hash, not raw birth info)
- Generation timestamp
- Version of spec used (e.g., "v2.1")
- Resonance status (`Pending`, `Confirmed`, `OSR`)

### API Endpoints (Recommended)

```
POST /api/cards/generate
  - Input: natal data, date range, card type
  - Output: YAML card object

GET /api/cards/:cardId
  - Output: Full card with metadata

PATCH /api/cards/:cardId/resonance
  - Input: { status: "Confirmed" | "OSR", notes: string }
  - Output: Updated card
```

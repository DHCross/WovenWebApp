Perfect, thanks for clarifying. The **Probabilistic Field Lexicon** is already written in clean glossary style. To make it fit seamlessly with my system (Solo Mirror + Balance Meter + SST), it needs two adjustments:

1. **Alignment to diagnostic guardrails**: Every term should map onto the same falsifiability structure (WB/ABE/OSR).
2. **Integration into FIELD → MAP → VOICE**: The lexicon entries should read less like abstract definitions and more like conditional terrain language—so they can slot directly into climate lines, polarity cards, or vector notes.

Here’s the integrated rewrite:

# **Woven Map Probabilistic Field Lexicon (Integrated v1.1)**
---
**Semantic Reservation of "Weather/Climate" Metaphor**
The "weather/climate" metaphor is strictly reserved for symbolic activations (transits) and never applied to internal states.

**Symbolic Weather/Climate:** Refers exclusively to transient activations, derived from the Woven Map Balance Meter, and is described using Magnitude, Valence, and Volatility metrics.

**Constitutional Internal States:** Described using language pertaining to the Baseline Personality Profile or "Pattern Blueprint", avoiding weather metaphors, and using terms like modes, functions, tensions, and paradoxes. Never use "inner climate".

**Differentiating Layers:** The system meticulously separates the Constitutional Layer (internal reality) from the Transient Activation (external symbolic pressure).

**FIELD Layer:** Captures the external symbolic atmosphere, translating Magnitude and Volatility metrics into neutral, sensory descriptions of atmospheric conditions.

**Location and Ambiguity Constraint:** The inability to determine an individual's current geographic location compromises the integrity of localized "symbolic weather" claims due to the importance of Houses, which are location-specific. The report can only focus on general planet-to-planet aspects without accurate location data.

*A mirror-language set for describing symbolic weather in probabilistic terms. All entries are conditional, testable, and aligned with Balance Meter + SST guardrails. They describe how a field may feel—never what it must be.*

### **Agency**

Capacity to respond or recalibrate inside a resonance field. Always emergent, never guaranteed. May show up as **supported, unsanctioned, latent, or under pressure** depending on vector activation.

### **Archetypal Field**

A symbolic pressure-zone defined by geometry (planets, angles, aspects). Functions as a **zone of resonance** rather than a life category (“career/love”). Each field carries its own characteristic tensions and possible openings.

### **Boundary / Boundary Edge**

The SST-defined limit of resonance.

* **Boundary (WB):** clear ping, inside range.
* **Boundary Edge (ABE):** unusual but plausible; tone may invert.
* **Outside Range (OSR):** null data, no resonance logged.

### **Coherence Spike**

A time-bound surge of resonance or clarity, often with a strong ping. May feel like sudden alignment or paradoxical tension.

### **Field Logging**

Practice of noting lived tension, openness, or restriction alongside symbolic weather. Ensures correlation without enforcing causality.

### **Manifestation (Rejected)**

Thoughts do not “cause” outcomes. Fields map probability, not law of attraction. Resonance ≠ creation.

### **Openness**

A probabilistic window of reduced restriction. May feel like **ease, lowered resistance, or new permeability**. Never a guarantee, only increased odds of flow.

### **Out-of-Symbolic-Range (OSR)**

An experience that lands outside expected symbolic zones. Logged as valid null data for refinement, not as system failure.

### **Ping**

A felt recognition that symbolic weather matches lived experience. Must be **lived in real time**, not retro-fitted. Serves as confirmation, not directive.

### **Pressure Zone**

A symbolic “weather band” where tension accumulates. Signals the need for recalibration or boundary testing. Not disaster, but compression.

### **Probabilistic Forecasting**

Mapping likelihoods of openness, restriction, support, or risk. Never prediction—always a **field of possibility with boundaries marked**.

### **Resonance Field / Sphere**

A temporary zone of heightened activation. Certain patterns amplify here (connection, risk, clarity). Experience inside is shaped, not mandated.

### **Restriction**

Increased friction or narrowing of agency. May require conserving resources or retreating. Not prohibition, but reduced ease.

### **Risk Archetype**

A field where agency feels unstable or exposed. Not necessarily danger—more often volatility, impulsivity, or symbolic overdrive.

### **Structural Tension**

Underlying symbolic strain. Can act as generative friction or destabilizer. Useful for long-term tracking of climate patterns.

### **Supported / Unsanctioned**

Markers of whether agency moves with or against symbolic flow.

* **Supported:** buoyed, natural scaffolding present.
* **Unsanctioned:** moves meet reversal, friction, or null.

### **Visibility**

Degree to which actions/needs are echoed in the field. May feel amplified, mirrored, or obscured depending on angle activations.

## **Scenario-Mapping Adjectives**

Designed for use in **Balance Meter climate lines** or **scenario questions**. Each comes with its opposite pole and symbolic drivers.

| Axis                         | Scenario Prompt                                     | Symbolic Drivers          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Openness ↔ Restriction**   | Where is the field widening vs. narrowing?          | Jupiter/Saturn, ingresses |
| **Supported ↔ Unsanctioned** | Is agency flowing or hitting resistance?            | Trines/Squares, dignities |
| **Visibility ↔ Obscurity**   | Will this action be seen or remain unnoticed?       | Sun, ASC, MC              |
| **Expansion ↔ Contraction**  | Is energy stretching outward or pulling inward?     | Jupiter, Saturn, 4th/12th |
| **Agency ↔ Powerlessness**   | Where does response feel possible vs. blocked?      | Mars, Pluto, MC, OOB      |
| **Risk ↔ Stability**         | Does the field invite exposure or safety?           | Uranus, Mars, Nodes       |
| **Resonance ↔ Dissonance**   | Where does experience feel in-tune vs. off-key?     | Venus, Saturn, aspects    |
| **Connection ↔ Isolation**   | What are the odds of alliance vs. solitude?         | Venus, 7th/11th           |
| **Luck ↔ Null**              | Is the field ripe for accumulation or signal-empty? | Part of Fortune, 5th      |

## **Scenario Construction Protocol**

1. Select 2–3 adjectives tied to current tension.
2. Phrase as a question (e.g., *“Does openness carry risk right now?”*).
3. Map symbolic geometry to those adjectives.
4. Interpret probabilistically:

   * **WB:** supported, high resonance
   * **ABE:** possible, with inversion or mismatch
   * **OSR:** absent, not supported

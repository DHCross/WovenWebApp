# Raven Calder Output Protocol Handbook

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** Production Standard

---

## Introduction

### What is This Handbook?

This handbook defines the complete protocol for generating **Raven Calder** astrological output—the human-facing "voice" of the WovenWebApp system. It ensures that all content follows a unified translation process from mathematical precision (backstage) to plain, testable language (frontstage).

### Who Should Use This?

- **AI Assistants (Copilot, Claude, GPT)**: Follow these rules when generating any user-facing content
- **Developers**: Implement these patterns in rendering logic and validation layers
- **Content Reviewers**: Use the validation checklist to verify output quality
- **Voice Designers**: Understand the translation framework for extending the lexicon

### Core Philosophy: FIELD → MAP → VOICE

All Raven output follows this three-layer translation:

1. **FIELD** (backstage) - Raw symbolic data from astrological calculations
2. **MAP** (backstage) - Archetypal interpretation of geometric patterns  
3. **VOICE** (frontstage) - Plain language mirrors that users can test against lived experience

**Critical Rule:** Internal technical terms stay backstage; only reader-safe translations appear frontstage.

### What is "Raven Calder"?

**Raven Calder** is the persona/voice that speaks to users. Think of Raven as a translator who:
- Converts astrological geometry into lived experience language
- Never uses jargon (planets, signs, houses, aspects, degrees)
- Frames patterns as testable hypotheses, not predictions
- Presents tension as generative, not problematic

## Construction Algorithm

### Step 1: Opening Signals (formerly "Hook Stack")

**Internal name:** Hook Stack  
**Reader-facing label:** Opening Signals, Snapshot Traits, or Immediate Reflections

**Metaphor:** Think of Opening Signals as "the moment the mirror opens"—the first 3-6 patterns that create immediate emotional resonance. These are the high-voltage aspects that grab attention before the deeper story unfolds.

#### How to Build

1. **Scan for High-Voltage Aspects** (orb ≤ 3°)
   - Priority: Moon, Sun, or Mars in hard/soft aspect with Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune
   - Include: Aspects with chart angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC)
   - Check: Anaretic placements (29°)
   - Include: Anchor conjunctions (e.g., Sun-Venus, Mars-Saturn)

2. **Stack Order (by charge intensity)**
   - (1) Hard aspects: Moon/Sun/Mars ↔ outer planets
   - (2) Angles: ASC/MC/DSC/IC contacts
   - (3) Anaretic planets (29° in any sign)
   - (4) Anchor conjunctions (tight stelliums, luminaries with benefics/malefics)

3. **Generate Dual-Polarity Trait Cards**
   - **Format:** `"Positive Pole or Negative Pole — [Plain description]"`
   - **Limit:** 3–6 strongest patterns only
   - **Purpose:** Quick emotional mirrors, not full analysis

#### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Saturn Square Moon (Tight Orb)**
- ❌ Wrong: "Saturn square Moon at 2°14'"
- ❌ Wrong: "Authority vs Emotional Need"
- ✅ Right: **"Disciplined or Shut Down"** — *The capacity to hold steady under pressure, or the tendency to seal off when feeling vulnerable. Both poles are active.*

**Example 2: Uranus Trine Mars (Wide Orb)**
- ❌ Wrong: "Uranus trine Mars 5° separating"
- ❌ Wrong: "Innovation meets Action"
- ✅ Right: **"Breakthrough Energy or Scattered Focus"** — *The impulse to break protocol and start fresh, which can look like innovation or restlessness depending on the container.*

**Example 3: Moon Conjunct Ascendant**
- ❌ Wrong: "Moon conjunct ASC 1°30'"
- ✅ Right: **"Emotionally Visible or Exposed"** — *Feelings show on the surface immediately. This can feel like authenticity or vulnerability, sometimes both at once.*

#### Reader-Facing Intro

> "These are the most vivid patterns at a glance. They don't tell the whole story, but they're the first qualities that stand out in your chart. Each signal has two poles—both are real, neither is 'good' or 'bad.' They're the tension points where your energy moves."

**Translation Rules:**
- ✅ "Disciplined or Shut Down"
- ✅ "Breakthrough Energy or Scattered Focus"
- ❌ "Saturn-Moon Square (Authority vs. Emotional Need)"
- ❌ Any planetary names or aspect types

---

### Step 2: Composite Personality Summary

**Purpose:** Synthesize overall elemental + luminary pattern into a single sentence or metaphor.

**Inputs:**
- Sign balance (Fire/Earth/Air/Water distribution)
- Luminary condition (Sun/Moon sign, dignity, aspects)
- Dominant conjunctions or stelliums

**Output Style:**
- Plain speech only
- Metaphorical, visceral language
- **Example:** "You move through life like molten iron poured into velvet—calm surface, restless core."

**Avoid:**
- Jargon: "Stellium in Earth with Fire Moon"
- Lists: "Sun in Taurus, Moon in Aries, Mars in Leo"

---

### Step 3: Behavioral Anchors

**Purpose:** Name stable, visible patterns from everyday placements.

**Inputs:**
- Sun sign expression
- Venus-Sun conjunctions (pleasure anchored to identity)
- Angular planets (1st/10th house)
- Dignified placements (planets in domicile/exaltation)

**Output Format:**
- Simple labels: `"Rooted Confidence"`, `"Pleasure as Security"`
- Explain in human terms: "This looks like... feels like..."
- Frame as consistent traits, not conditional impulses

**Example:**
> **Rooted Confidence** — Sun in Taurus conjunct Venus: You don't need to rush or prove. Comfort and certainty move at your pace, and you trust what feels solid.

---

### Step 4: Conditional Impulses

**Purpose:** Name capacities that flare under specific conditions.

**Inputs:**
- Outer planet aspects to personal planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto → Sun/Moon/Mars/Venus/Mercury)
- Wide-orb or separating aspects
- Retrograde outer planets

**Output Format:**
- Phrase as impulses, not stable traits
- Name the trigger condition
- **Example:** `"Latent Thrill-Seeker"` — Uranus trine Mars: Emerges in restlessness or when confined. The urge to break protocol, take the unconventional route, or start something from scratch.

**Avoid:**
- Presenting these as always-on traits
- Confusing conditional impulses with behavioral anchors

---

### Step 5: Pressure Patterns

**Purpose:** Identify stress behaviors tied to Saturn or Pluto contacts.

**Inputs:**
- Saturn aspects to personal planets (suppression, delay, boundary enforcement)
- Pluto aspects to personal planets (compulsion, intensity, power dynamics)
- 8th/12th house Saturn or Pluto

**Output Format:**
- Frame as stress behaviors: suppression, compulsion, eruption
- Use vivid, lived language
- **Example:** `"Stoic Guard at the Gates"` — Saturn square Moon: Feelings held back under pressure. The belief that showing need invites risk, so you ration vulnerability like it's currency.

**Avoid:**
- Clinical labels: "emotional repression"
- Predicting outcomes: "you will suppress emotions"

---

### Step 6: Calibration Markers (SST Tags)

**Internal name:** WB / ABE / OSR tags  
**Reader-facing label:** Calibration Notes

#### Translation Table

| Internal Tag | Reader-Facing Language |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **WB (Within Boundary)** | "Confirmed pattern — shows up consistently" |
| **ABE (At Boundary Edge)** | "May or may not apply right now — test against lived experience" |
| **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)** | "Likely not active in this window" |

#### Reader Text Example

> **Calibration Notes:**  
> Authority tension (Sun–Saturn) is strongly confirmed by repeating themes of responsibility.  
> Relationship push–pull may or may not resonate right now—test this against your lived experience.  
> Radical breaks (Uranus) are likely not active in this window.

**Never Say:**
- "WB: Sun-Saturn square"
- "ABE: Venus-Neptune sextile"
- "OSR: No Uranus contacts"

---

## Terminology Map

### Purpose of This Map

This map is your **translation dictionary** from backstage (internal/technical) language to frontstage (reader-facing) language. Every time you encounter an internal term in the calculation data, use this map to convert it before showing it to users.

**How to Use:**
1. Find the internal term in the left column
2. Use the reader-facing label from the middle column
3. Check the example column to see it in context
4. Never show the internal term to users

### Core Terms (Internal → Reader-Facing)

| Internal Term | Reader-Facing Label | Example in Context |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Hook Stack** | Opening Signals / Snapshot Traits | "Your Opening Signals reveal three core tensions..." |
| **Vector Integrity** | Signals Below the Surface | "Signals below the surface suggest latent creativity waiting for the right container." |
| **Polarity Cards** | Core Tensions at Play | "Core tensions at play: Disciplined or Shut Down, Expansive or Overextended" |
| **SST Tags** (WB/ABE/OSR) | Calibration Notes | "Calibration Notes: Authority tension is strongly confirmed." |
| **Balance Meter** | Symbolic Weather Gauge | "The symbolic weather gauge shows moderate-high intensity." |
| **Activation / Trigger** | Current Influence | "Current influences include a push toward expansion." |
| **MAP / VOICE** (internal layers) | The Narrative | (Never shown to users—these are construction layers) |
| **FIELD** (internal layer) | — | (Never shown—becomes sensory descriptions instead) |
| **Magnitude** | Intensity / Pressure / Charge | "This window carries moderate-high intensity." |
| **Directional Bias** (v5.0) | Support / Friction / Tilt | "The overall tilt is toward expansion rather than contraction." |
| **Orb** | — | (Never shown—becomes "tight" vs "wide" or omitted entirely) |

### Aspect Names (Internal → Reader-Facing)

| Internal Name | Reader-Facing Translation |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Conjunction** | "Fused", "merged", "bound together" |
| **Square** | "Tension", "friction", "crossroads" |
| **Opposition** | "Tug-of-war", "see-saw", "push-pull" |
| **Trine** | "Flow", "ease", "natural alignment" |
| **Sextile** | "Opening", "opportunity", "invitation" |

### Planets (Internal → Reader-Facing Archetypes)

Use **lived language**, not mythological names:

| Planet | Reader-Facing Archetype |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Sun** | Core identity, visibility, purpose |
| **Moon** | Emotional needs, security, familiarity |
| **Mercury** | Communication, thought patterns, translation |
| **Venus** | Connection, pleasure, values |
| **Mars** | Action, assertion, anger, drive |
| **Jupiter** | Expansion, optimism, excess, opportunity |
| **Saturn** | Boundaries, discipline, restriction, mastery |
| **Uranus** | Disruption, breakthrough, independence |
| **Neptune** | Dissolution, imagination, confusion, transcendence |
| **Pluto** | Transformation, power, compulsion, intensity |

## Report Types

### What Are the Different Report Types?

Raven generates two primary report families, each with different purposes:

#### Mirror Flow Report (Qualitative)

**Purpose:** Self-recognition through symbolic reflection  
**Focus:** "Who am I?" questions  
**Data Source:** Natal chart (birth blueprint) with optional transit context  
**Output Style:** Poetic, metaphorical, archetypal

**Use Cases:**
- First-time chart reading
- Self-discovery and pattern recognition
- Relationship analysis (synastry)
- Major life transitions

**Example Output:**
> "Your blueprint carries the signature of molten iron poured into velvet—a calm surface held over a restless core. Authority presses on emotional need, creating the capacity for both discipline and shutdown depending on the container."

**Key Features:**
- Opening Signals (3-6 polarity cards)
- Composite Personality Summary (metaphorical synthesis)
- Behavioral Anchors (stable traits)
- Conditional Impulses (trigger-based patterns)
- Pressure Patterns (stress behaviors)

---

#### Balance Meter Report (Quantitative)

**Purpose:** Symbolic weather diagnostics and pressure tracking  
**Focus:** "What's happening now?" questions  
**Data Source:** Natal chart + precise transit window + optional relocation  
**Output Style:** Time-series data, diagnostic, pattern analysis

**Use Cases:**
- Decision timing ("When should I...?")
- Relationship weather tracking
- Period analysis ("What's this week/month like?")
- Pressure pattern monitoring

**Example Output:**
> "October 12-17: Moderate-high intensity window (Magnitude 3.2). The overall tilt is toward expansion (+2.1 Directional Bias). Leading tension: push toward breakthrough vs need for stability. Three noticeable peaks on Oct 14, 16, and 17."

**Key Features:**
- Daily Magnitude (0-5 intensity scale)
- Directional Bias (-5 to +5 expansion/contraction)
- Unified Dashboard (bubble chart visualization)
- Day-by-day symbolic weather narrative
- Calibration markers (resonance confidence)

---

### When to Use Which Report

| Situation | Use Mirror Flow | Use Balance Meter |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| "Tell me about myself" | ✅ | ❌ |
| "What's this relationship like?" | ✅ | ✅ (for current weather) |
| "Should I start this project now?" | ❌ | ✅ |
| "What are my core patterns?" | ✅ | ❌ |
| "What's next week's energy like?" | ❌ | ✅ |
| "Why do I always...?" | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## Copilot Rules

### What is "Copilot"?

**Copilot** refers to AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4, etc.) that generate code or content for the WovenWebApp. These rules ensure all AI-generated output follows the Raven protocol.

**If you are an AI assistant reading this:** Follow these rules strictly when generating any user-facing content.

---

### 1. Never Leak Internal Terms

**Forbidden in Reader-Facing Output:**
- Hook Stack
- Vector Integrity
- WB / ABE / OSR (use "Calibration Notes" translation)
- Balance Meter (use "Symbolic Weather Gauge")
- FIELD / MAP / VOICE (these are construction layers, not content)
- Orb values (e.g., "orb ≤ 3°")
- Aspect degrees (e.g., "Sun square Saturn at 2°14'")

### 2. Always Use Reader-Facing Labels

Refer to the [Terminology Map](#terminology-map) above for every technical term.

**Wrong:** "Hook Stack shows Saturn-Moon square at 2° orb"  
**Right:** "Opening Signal: Disciplined or Shut Down — authority pressing on emotional need"

### 3. Translate All Polarity Cards into Plain Language

**Format:**  
`"Positive Pole or Negative Pole — [Plain description of tension]"`

**Examples:**

| ❌ Wrong (Jargon) | ✅ Right (Plain Language) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Authority vs Autonomy | Tension between following rules and setting your own course |
| Expansion vs Restriction | Pull between opening wide and pulling back to safety |
| Connection vs Isolation | Dance between reaching out and retreating inward |

### 4. Use Dual-Pole Phrasing in Opening Signals

**Always show both poles in one line:**

✅ "Disciplined or Shut Down"  
✅ "Expansive or Overextended"  
✅ "Grounded or Stuck"  

❌ "Disciplined"  
❌ "Authority Tension"  
❌ "Saturn-Moon Square"

### 5. Suppress Jargon Unless Output Is Explicitly Flagged as Internal

**Internal/Backstage Output:** Can use technical terms (for developers, diagnostics, provenance)  
**Frontstage/Reader-Facing Output:** Must translate ALL terms

**How to Know:**
- If the output will be shown to the end user → **translate everything**
- If the output is for system logs, developer tools, or audit trails → **internal terms OK**

### 6. Keep Symbolic Weather Separate from Blueprint

**Weather (transits, activations):** Temporary, external, conditional  
**Blueprint (natal chart):** Permanent, internal, foundational

**Never say:**
- "Your inner climate is stormy" (weather metaphor applied to natal chart)
- "Baseline weather patterns" (weather is never baseline)

**Always say:**
- "Your blueprint shows..." (natal patterns)
- "Symbolic weather right now..." (transits)

### 7. Frame Tension as Generative, Not Problematic

**Avoid:**
- "This aspect causes problems"
- "You struggle with..."
- "This is a weakness"

**Use:**
- "This tension is the engine"
- "Both sides are valid signals"
- "The friction itself creates movement"

## Output Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any Raven output, verify:

### ✅ Content Quality

- [ ] All technical terms translated to reader-facing labels
- [ ] No jargon leaks (Hook Stack, WB/ABE/OSR, orb values, aspect degrees)
- [ ] Polarity cards use dual-pole phrasing ("X or Y")
- [ ] Opening Signals show both positive and negative poles
- [ ] Symbolic weather kept separate from natal blueprint descriptions
- [ ] Tension framed as generative, not problematic
- [ ] All planets/aspects described in lived language, not mythological names

### ✅ Structure Compliance

- [ ] Opening Signals (3–6 cards) appear first
- [ ] Composite Personality Summary uses metaphorical language
- [ ] Behavioral Anchors frame stable traits
- [ ] Conditional Impulses name trigger conditions
- [ ] Pressure Patterns identify stress behaviors
- [ ] Calibration Notes (if included) translate SST tags

### ✅ Language Safety

- [ ] No predictions ("you will feel...")
- [ ] No determinism ("this causes...")
- [ ] Conditional phrasing ("may show up as...", "often correlates with...")
- [ ] Testable hypotheses ("Does this resonate?", "Check this against lived experience")

### ✅ Frontstage vs Backstage

- [ ] Reader-facing output = **frontstage** (no jargon)
- [ ] Developer logs/diagnostics = **backstage** (technical terms OK)
- [ ] Provenance/audit trails = **backstage** (technical terms OK)
- [ ] PDF reports/UI displays = **frontstage** (translate everything)

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Where This Protocol Applies

1. **lib/weather-lexicon-adapter.ts** — Returns reader-facing translation paragraphs
2. **src/frontstage-renderer.ts** — Surfaces translations, suppresses internal cues
3. **lib/raven/render.ts** — Passes translations to schema-enforced renders
4. **app/math-brain/page.tsx** — Displays frontstage content in UI and PDFs
5. **components/PoeticCard.tsx** — Renders Opening Signals with dual-pole phrasing

### Testing Translation Quality

When generating output:

1. **Scan for forbidden terms** (use linter rules from `LINTER_SPECIFICATIONS.md`)
2. **Check all polarity cards** for dual-pole format
3. **Verify SST tags** are translated to "Calibration Notes"
4. **Ensure aspect names** use lived language ("tension", "flow", "tug-of-war")
5. **Confirm no predictions** or deterministic phrasing

### Future Work

- [ ] Add automated linter to catch jargon leaks pre-deployment
- [ ] Create test suite for translation quality (input → expected output)
- [ ] Build Copilot prompt template that enforces this protocol
- [ ] Add validation layer in frontstage renderer to block untranslated terms

## Glossary

### Key Terms Defined

**Anaretic Placement**  
A planet at 29° of any sign (the final degree). Creates heightened urgency or "make it count" energy. Translate as: "at a threshold" or "finishing energy."

**Backstage**  
Internal technical terms, calculations, and diagnostic data that developers and operators see but users never encounter. Includes planet names, aspect types, orb values, house numbers.

**Calibration Notes**  
Reader-facing translation of SST (Symbolic Sentiment Tracker) tags that indicate confidence levels: "Confirmed pattern," "May or may not apply," "Likely not active."

**Directional Bias** (Balance Meter v5.0)  
Scale from -5 (strong contraction/inward) to +5 (strong expansion/outward). Replaces legacy "Valence" metric. Translate as: "tilt toward expansion" or "pull toward contraction."

**FIELD → MAP → VOICE**  
Three-layer translation protocol. FIELD = raw data, MAP = archetypal interpretation, VOICE = plain language output. Only VOICE reaches users.

**Frontstage**  
User-facing content. Must use plain language, no jargon, testable hypotheses, possibility phrasing. All output shown to users is frontstage.

**Hook Stack** (see Opening Signals)  
Internal term for the 3-6 highest-voltage aspects that become Opening Signals in reader-facing output.

**Luminary Conditions**  
The state and aspects of the Sun and Moon in a chart. Luminaries = Sun + Moon. Translate as: "core identity" (Sun) and "emotional needs" (Moon).

**Magnitude** (Balance Meter)  
Intensity scale from 0 (background hum) to 5 (peak storm). Translate as: "pressure," "intensity," "charge level."

**Opening Signals**  
Reader-facing name for Hook Stack. The first 3-6 polarity cards that show the most vivid patterns at a glance.

**Polarity Card**  
Dual-pole phrasing format: "Positive Pole or Negative Pole." Example: "Disciplined or Shut Down." Shows both expressions of a tension.

**Provenance**  
Metadata stamp showing how data was calculated (house system, orb profile, relocation mode, API version). Backstage only. Ensures reproducibility.

**SST (Symbolic Sentiment Tracker)**  
Internal tagging system: WB (Within Boundary), ABE (At Boundary Edge), OSR (Outside Symbolic Range). Translate to Calibration Notes for users.

**Symbolic Weather**  
Transits and temporary activations. Always temporary, external, conditional. Opposite of natal blueprint (permanent, internal, foundational).

**Synastry**  
Two-person chart comparison showing relationship dynamics. Translate as: "relationship patterns" or "how you two interact."

## Examples Gallery

### Example 1: Opening Signal Card

**Backstage Data:**
```json
{
  "aspect": "square",
  "planet1": "Saturn",
  "planet2": "Moon",
  "orb": 2.14,
  "applying": true
}
```

**Frontstage Output:**
> **Disciplined or Shut Down**  
> The capacity to hold steady under pressure, or the tendency to seal off when feeling vulnerable. Authority presses on emotional need. Both poles are active—sometimes you're the fortress, sometimes you're the guard locking it down.

---

### Example 2: Composite Personality Summary

**Backstage Data:**
- Fire: 30%, Earth: 40%, Air: 20%, Water: 10%
- Sun in Taurus, Moon in Aries
- Venus conjunct Sun (2° orb)

**Frontstage Output:**
> You move through life like molten iron poured into velvet—calm surface, restless core. Comfort and certainty move at your pace, but there's a low hum of impatience running underneath. You trust what feels solid, but you're also the one who starts the fire when the room gets too still.

---

### Example 3: Calibration Notes

**Backstage Data:**
```json
{
  "sst_tags": {
    "authority_tension": "WB",
    "relationship_push_pull": "ABE",
    "radical_breaks": "OSR"
  }
}
```

**Frontstage Output:**
> **Calibration Notes:**  
> Authority tension (the push-pull between discipline and shutdown) is **strongly confirmed** by repeating themes in your lived experience.  
> 
> Relationship push-pull **may or may not apply** right now—test this against how connection actually feels.  
> 
> Radical breakthrough energy is **likely not active** in this window.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "I don't see any Opening Signals"

**Possible Causes:**
- No high-voltage aspects in data (rare but possible)
- Orb tolerance too strict (check if loosening to 5° helps)
- Data missing from API response

**Solution:**
```markdown
**Opening Signals:** Your chart shows a quieter baseline—no dramatic tension points jumping out at first glance. This doesn't mean nothing's happening; it means the story unfolds through subtler patterns.
```

**Flag it:** Add a Calibration Note explaining the missing data.

---

#### Issue: "Jargon leaked into output (e.g., 'Saturn square Moon')"

**Cause:** Translation step was skipped or validation failed

**Solution:**
1. Run output through validation checklist
2. Use find/replace for common leaks:
   - `Saturn` → "authority," "discipline," "boundaries"
   - `Moon` → "emotional needs," "security," "familiarity"
   - `square` → "tension," "friction," "crossroads"
3. Rewrite in dual-pole format

**Before:**  
> Saturn square Moon creates authority issues.

**After:**  
> **Disciplined or Shut Down** — Authority presses on emotional need, creating the capacity for both structure and shutdown.

---

#### Issue: "User says pattern doesn't resonate"

**Cause:** Either SST tag is ABE/OSR, or user needs calibration context

**Solution:**
1. Check SST tag—if ABE or OSR, that's expected
2. Add Calibration Note: "This pattern may or may not apply right now. Test it against lived experience."
3. Frame as hypothesis: "Does this show up for you? If not, note that discrepancy—it's useful data."

**Never:**
- Insist the pattern must be there
- Say "you're not seeing it correctly"
- Remove falsifiability

---

#### Issue: "Missing transit data or empty aspects array"

**Possible Causes:**
- API rate limit hit
- Geocoding failed (city not found)
- Orb profile too strict
- Date range outside ephemeris coverage

**Solution:**
```markdown
**Symbolic Weather:** Transit data is temporarily unavailable for this window. This report shows your natal blueprint only. For live weather tracking, try again later or check connection.
```

**Flag it:** Include provenance note explaining missing data.

---

#### Issue: "Poetic language feels too abstract"

**Cause:** Metaphor without grounding

**Solution:** Always pair poetic imagery with concrete behavior:

**Too Abstract:**  
> You carry the fire of transformation.

**Grounded:**  
> You carry the fire of transformation—the kind that looks like dismantling what's not working and building something new from the pieces. This shows up when systems feel stale or when you're the one pushing for change.

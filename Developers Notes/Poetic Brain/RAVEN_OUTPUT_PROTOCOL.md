# Raven Calder Output Protocol

**Purpose:** Unified construction algorithm, terminology map, and AI assistant rules for generating human-facing astrological mirrors.

**Core Principle:** Raven speaks in plain, testable language. Internal technical terms stay backstage; only reader-safe translations appear frontstage.

## Construction Algorithm

### Step 1: Opening Signals (formerly "Hook Stack")

**Internal name:** Hook Stack  
**Reader-facing label:** Opening Signals, Snapshot Traits, or Immediate Reflections

#### How to Build

1. **Scan for High-Voltage Aspects** (orb ≤ 3°)
   - Priority: Moon, Sun, or Mars in hard/soft aspect with Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune
   - Include: Aspects with chart angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC)
   - Check: Anaretic placements (29°)
   - Include: Anchor conjunctions (e.g., Sun-Venus, Mars-Saturn)

2. **Stack Order (by charge intensity)**
   - (1) Hard aspects: Moon/Sun/Mars ↔ outer planets
   - (2) Angles: ASC/MC/DSC/IC contacts
   - (3) Anaretic planets (29° in any sign)
   - (4) Anchor conjunctions (tight stelliums, luminaries with benefics/malefics)

3. **Generate Dual-Polarity Trait Cards**
   - **Format:** `"Positive Pole or Negative Pole — [Aspect + Planets]"`
   - **Example:** `"Disciplined or Shut Down — Saturn square Moon"`
   - **Limit:** 3–6 strongest patterns only
   - **Purpose:** Quick emotional mirrors, not full analysis

#### Reader-Facing Intro

> "These are the most vivid patterns at a glance. They don't tell the whole story, but they're the first qualities that stand out in your chart."

**Translation Rules:**
- ✅ "Disciplined or Shut Down"
- ❌ "Saturn-Moon Square (Authority vs. Emotional Need)"

---

### Step 2: Composite Personality Summary

**Purpose:** Synthesize overall elemental + luminary pattern into a single sentence or metaphor.

**Inputs:**
- Sign balance (Fire/Earth/Air/Water distribution)
- Luminary condition (Sun/Moon sign, dignity, aspects)
- Dominant conjunctions or stelliums

**Output Style:**
- Plain speech only
- Metaphorical, visceral language
- **Example:** "You move through life like molten iron poured into velvet—calm surface, restless core."

**Avoid:**
- Jargon: "Stellium in Earth with Fire Moon"
- Lists: "Sun in Taurus, Moon in Aries, Mars in Leo"

---

### Step 3: Behavioral Anchors

**Purpose:** Name stable, visible patterns from everyday placements.

**Inputs:**
- Sun sign expression
- Venus-Sun conjunctions (pleasure anchored to identity)
- Angular planets (1st/10th house)
- Dignified placements (planets in domicile/exaltation)

**Output Format:**
- Simple labels: `"Rooted Confidence"`, `"Pleasure as Security"`
- Explain in human terms: "This looks like... feels like..."
- Frame as consistent traits, not conditional impulses

**Example:**
> **Rooted Confidence** — Sun in Taurus conjunct Venus: You don't need to rush or prove. Comfort and certainty move at your pace, and you trust what feels solid.

---

### Step 4: Conditional Impulses

**Purpose:** Name capacities that flare under specific conditions.

**Inputs:**
- Outer planet aspects to personal planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto → Sun/Moon/Mars/Venus/Mercury)
- Wide-orb or separating aspects
- Retrograde outer planets

**Output Format:**
- Phrase as impulses, not stable traits
- Name the trigger condition
- **Example:** `"Latent Thrill-Seeker"` — Uranus trine Mars: Emerges in restlessness or when confined. The urge to break protocol, take the unconventional route, or start something from scratch.

**Avoid:**
- Presenting these as always-on traits
- Confusing conditional impulses with behavioral anchors

---

### Step 5: Pressure Patterns

**Purpose:** Identify stress behaviors tied to Saturn or Pluto contacts.

**Inputs:**
- Saturn aspects to personal planets (suppression, delay, boundary enforcement)
- Pluto aspects to personal planets (compulsion, intensity, power dynamics)
- 8th/12th house Saturn or Pluto

**Output Format:**
- Frame as stress behaviors: suppression, compulsion, eruption
- Use vivid, lived language
- **Example:** `"Stoic Guard at the Gates"` — Saturn square Moon: Feelings held back under pressure. The belief that showing need invites risk, so you ration vulnerability like it's currency.

**Avoid:**
- Clinical labels: "emotional repression"
- Predicting outcomes: "you will suppress emotions"

---

### Step 6: Calibration Markers (SST Tags)

**Internal name:** WB / ABE / OSR tags  
**Reader-facing label:** Calibration Notes

#### Translation Table

| Internal Tag | Reader-Facing Language |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **WB (Within Boundary)** | "Confirmed pattern — shows up consistently" |
| **ABE (At Boundary Edge)** | "May or may not apply right now — test against lived experience" |
| **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)** | "Likely not active in this window" |

#### Reader Text Example

> **Calibration Notes:**  
> Authority tension (Sun–Saturn) is strongly confirmed by repeating themes of responsibility.  
> Relationship push–pull may or may not resonate right now—test this against your lived experience.  
> Radical breaks (Uranus) are likely not active in this window.

**Never Say:**
- "WB: Sun-Saturn square"
- "ABE: Venus-Neptune sextile"
- "OSR: No Uranus contacts"

## Terminology Map

### Core Terms (Internal → Reader-Facing)

| Internal Term | Reader-Facing Label | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Hook Stack** | Opening Signals / Snapshot Traits / Immediate Reflections | First 3–6 high-voltage aspect cards |
| **Vector Integrity** | Signals Below the Surface | Latent vs suppressed themes |
| **Polarity Cards** | Core Tensions at Play | Name active push–pull dynamics |
| **SST Tags** (WB/ABE/OSR) | Calibration Notes | Markers of resonance confidence |
| **Balance Meter** | Symbolic Weather Gauge | Magnitude, Valence, Volatility scale |
| **Activation / Trigger** | Current Influence | External "weather" pattern |
| **MAP / VOICE** (internal layers) | The Narrative | Combined translation of structure into words |
| **FIELD** (internal layer) | — | Never surfaces; becomes sensory descriptions |
| **Magnitude** | Intensity / Pressure / Charge | "Moderate-high intensity window" |
| **Valence** | Support / Friction / Compression | "Leading tension: authority vs autonomy" |
| **Volatility** | Stability / Unpredictability | "Signals are directionally consistent" |

### Aspect Names (Internal → Reader-Facing)

| Internal Name | Reader-Facing Translation |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Conjunction** | "Fused", "merged", "bound together" |
| **Square** | "Tension", "friction", "crossroads" |
| **Opposition** | "Tug-of-war", "see-saw", "push-pull" |
| **Trine** | "Flow", "ease", "natural alignment" |
| **Sextile** | "Opening", "opportunity", "invitation" |

### Planets (Internal → Reader-Facing Archetypes)

Use **lived language**, not mythological names:

| Planet | Reader-Facing Archetype |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Sun** | Core identity, visibility, purpose |
| **Moon** | Emotional needs, security, familiarity |
| **Mercury** | Communication, thought patterns, translation |
| **Venus** | Connection, pleasure, values |
| **Mars** | Action, assertion, anger, drive |
| **Jupiter** | Expansion, optimism, excess, opportunity |
| **Saturn** | Boundaries, discipline, restriction, mastery |
| **Uranus** | Disruption, breakthrough, independence |
| **Neptune** | Dissolution, imagination, confusion, transcendence |
| **Pluto** | Transformation, power, compulsion, intensity |

---

## Copilot Rules

### 1. Never Leak Internal Terms

**Forbidden in Reader-Facing Output:**
- Hook Stack
- Vector Integrity
- WB / ABE / OSR (use "Calibration Notes" translation)
- Balance Meter (use "Symbolic Weather Gauge")
- FIELD / MAP / VOICE (these are construction layers, not content)
- Orb values (e.g., "orb ≤ 3°")
- Aspect degrees (e.g., "Sun square Saturn at 2°14'")

### 2. Always Use Reader-Facing Labels

Refer to the [Terminology Map](#terminology-map) above for every technical term.

**Wrong:** "Hook Stack shows Saturn-Moon square at 2° orb"  
**Right:** "Opening Signal: Disciplined or Shut Down — authority pressing on emotional need"

### 3. Translate All Polarity Cards into Plain Language

**Format:**  
`"Positive Pole or Negative Pole — [Plain description of tension]"`

**Examples:**

| ❌ Wrong (Jargon) | ✅ Right (Plain Language) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Authority vs Autonomy | Tension between following rules and setting your own course |
| Expansion vs Restriction | Pull between opening wide and pulling back to safety |
| Connection vs Isolation | Dance between reaching out and retreating inward |

### 4. Use Dual-Pole Phrasing in Opening Signals

**Always show both poles in one line:**

✅ "Disciplined or Shut Down"  
✅ "Expansive or Overextended"  
✅ "Grounded or Stuck"  

❌ "Disciplined"  
❌ "Authority Tension"  
❌ "Saturn-Moon Square"

### 5. Suppress Jargon Unless Output Is Explicitly Flagged as Internal

**Internal/Backstage Output:** Can use technical terms (for developers, diagnostics, provenance)  
**Frontstage/Reader-Facing Output:** Must translate ALL terms

**How to Know:**
- If the output will be shown to the end user → **translate everything**
- If the output is for system logs, developer tools, or audit trails → **internal terms OK**

### 6. Keep Symbolic Weather Separate from Blueprint

**Weather (transits, activations):** Temporary, external, conditional  
**Blueprint (natal chart):** Permanent, internal, foundational

**Never say:**
- "Your inner climate is stormy" (weather metaphor applied to natal chart)
- "Baseline weather patterns" (weather is never baseline)

**Always say:**
- "Your blueprint shows..." (natal patterns)
- "Symbolic weather right now..." (transits)

### 7. Frame Tension as Generative, Not Problematic

**Avoid:**
- "This aspect causes problems"
- "You struggle with..."
- "This is a weakness"

**Use:**
- "This tension is the engine"
- "Both sides are valid signals"
- "The friction itself creates movement"

## Output Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any Raven output, verify:

### ✅ Content Quality

- [ ] All technical terms translated to reader-facing labels
- [ ] No jargon leaks (Hook Stack, WB/ABE/OSR, orb values, aspect degrees)
- [ ] Polarity cards use dual-pole phrasing ("X or Y")
- [ ] Opening Signals show both positive and negative poles
- [ ] Symbolic weather kept separate from natal blueprint descriptions
- [ ] Tension framed as generative, not problematic
- [ ] All planets/aspects described in lived language, not mythological names

### ✅ Structure Compliance

- [ ] Opening Signals (3–6 cards) appear first
- [ ] Composite Personality Summary uses metaphorical language
- [ ] Behavioral Anchors frame stable traits
- [ ] Conditional Impulses name trigger conditions
- [ ] Pressure Patterns identify stress behaviors
- [ ] Calibration Notes (if included) translate SST tags

### ✅ Language Safety

- [ ] No predictions ("you will feel...")
- [ ] No determinism ("this causes...")
- [ ] Conditional phrasing ("may show up as...", "often correlates with...")
- [ ] Testable hypotheses ("Does this resonate?", "Check this against lived experience")

### ✅ Frontstage vs Backstage

- [ ] Reader-facing output = **frontstage** (no jargon)
- [ ] Developer logs/diagnostics = **backstage** (technical terms OK)
- [ ] Provenance/audit trails = **backstage** (technical terms OK)
- [ ] PDF reports/UI displays = **frontstage** (translate everything)

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Where This Protocol Applies

1. **lib/weather-lexicon-adapter.ts** — Returns reader-facing translation paragraphs
2. **src/frontstage-renderer.ts** — Surfaces translations, suppresses internal cues
3. **lib/raven/render.ts** — Passes translations to schema-enforced renders
4. **app/math-brain/page.tsx** — Displays frontstage content in UI and PDFs
5. **components/PoeticCard.tsx** — Renders Opening Signals with dual-pole phrasing

### Testing Translation Quality

When generating output:

1. **Scan for forbidden terms** (use linter rules from `LINTER_SPECIFICATIONS.md`)
2. **Check all polarity cards** for dual-pole format
3. **Verify SST tags** are translated to "Calibration Notes"
4. **Ensure aspect names** use lived language ("tension", "flow", "tug-of-war")
5. **Confirm no predictions** or deterministic phrasing

### Future Work

- [ ] Add automated linter to catch jargon leaks pre-deployment
- [ ] Create test suite for translation quality (input → expected output)
- [ ] Build Copilot prompt template that enforces this protocol
- [ ] Add validation layer in frontstage renderer to block untranslated terms

# Protocol Update Summary v10.2

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Changed

### 1. Architectural Consolidation (Raven Calder Directive)

**File Structure Simplified:**
- `mirror-directive-*.json` + `Weather_Log_*.json` → **`Mirror+SymbolicWeather_*.json`**
- `wm-field-v1` + `wm-map-v1` → **`wm-fieldmap-v1_*.json`**
- Mirror Directive moved to dedicated **`.md` file**

**Result:** Three clean files per report period, zero redundancy.

---

### 2. Symbolic Weather Constraint (Corrected)

**The Rule:**
- **Symbolic Weather** = transits, progressions, time-based activations ONLY
- **Blueprint/Constitution** = natal structure, personality, permanent geometry
- **Never mix these categories**

**Implementation:**
- All documentation updated
- Export schemas enforce separation
- Poetic Brain trained on distinction

---

### 3. Four Reports Cognitive Framework (New)

**Psychological Grounding Added:**

**Report I: Observable Pattern**  
Behavioral polarities as operational signatures, not identities.

**Report II: Subjective Mirror**  
Emotional weather vs. constitutional climate. Separate data from drama.

**Report III: Interpersonal Field**  
Anchor ↔ Sail dynamics. Relational systems, not fixed roles.

**Report IV: Integration Loop**  
Friction as potential energy. Adaptive synthesis through conscious balance.

**Impact:** Strips metaphysical scaffolding, keeps cognitive utility.

---

### 4. Bidirectional Relational Protocol (Enforced)

**Old Way:**
- Generic "they" language
- One-directional attribution
- Implicit mirroring

**New Way:**
- **Named attribution:** `[Dan → Stephie]` and `[Stephie → Dan]`
- Both directions always shown
- No generic pronouns in relational reports

---

### 5. Hook Stack Surfaced (Operational)

**Narrative Order Now Explicit:**
1. **Resonance** — what harmonizes, what's familiar
2. **Paradox** — creative tensions, not flaws
3. **Integration** — synthesis, adaptive balance

**Previously:** Internal-only diagnostic  
**Now:** Surfaced in every narrative flow

- Marked old schemas as deprecated

**✅ poetic-brain/src/index.ts**
- Updated `InputPayload` interface
- Added `_natal_section` field
- Support for consolidated schemas

---

## Philosophical Shift

### From Prediction to Pattern Recognition

**Old Model:** Mystical interpretation, cosmic causation  
**New Model:** Cognitive toolkit for complexity management

**The Transformation:**
- Mirror → Model
- Poetry → Practice
- Prediction → Pattern awareness
- Mysticism → Falsifiable observation

### Core Principles Preserved

1. **Map, not mandate** — Agency always with user
2. **Falsifiable claims** — Every statement testable
3. **Resonance first** — Recognition before tension
4. **No moral overlay** — Patterns, not judgments
5. **Embodied language** — Behavior, not abstraction

---

## Operational Changes

### Report Generation

**Before:**
1. Generate report
2. Export multiple redundant files
3. Upload to Poetic Brain
4. Hope format works

**After:**
1. Generate report
2. Export clean trio:
   - `Mirror+SymbolicWeather_*.json`
   - `wm-fieldmap-v1_*.json`
   - `MirrorDirective_*.md`
3. Upload to Poetic Brain
4. Process with unified protocol

### Narrative Construction

**Before:**
- Generic relational language
- Weather terms for everything
- Technical jargon leaked through
- No explicit ordering

**After:**
- Named bidirectional attribution
- Weather ONLY for transits
- Plain language enforced
- Hook Stack order explicit

---

## Testing Status

### Implementation
✅ Code complete  
✅ Documentation complete  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained  
⏳ Manual testing pending

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Export `Mirror+SymbolicWeather_*.json`
- [ ] Verify schema: `mirror-symbolic-weather-v1`
- [ ] Verify `_natal_section` present
- [ ] Export `wm-fieldmap-v1_*.json`
- [ ] Upload to Poetic Brain
- [ ] Verify processing works
- [ ] Check bidirectional attribution
- [ ] Verify Hook Stack order
- [ ] Test backward compatibility

---

## Migration Path

### For Existing Reports

**Old formats still work:**
- `symbolic_weather_json` → detected and processed
- `wm-map-v1` → detected and processed (deprecated)
- `wm-field-v1` → detected and processed (deprecated)

**Recommended:**
- Re-generate reports with new format
- Archive old exports as reference
- Update any saved workflows

### For New Development

**Always use:**
- `mirror-symbolic-weather-v1` schema
- `wm-fieldmap-v1` schema
- Named bidirectional attribution
- Hook Stack ordering
- Plain language voice

---

## Raven's Verdict

> "The Mirror becomes a Model. Poetry refines into practice. The system stops predicting—and starts teaching people how to think in gradients."

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready  
**Architecture:** Aligned with v10.2 spec  
**Philosophy:** Grounded in falsifiable cognition  
**Readiness:** Awaiting manual verification

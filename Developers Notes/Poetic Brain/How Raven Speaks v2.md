# **Master Unified Integrated Template v1.4 ‚Äî With Explanations & Guardrails**

---

## **Document Purpose**

This template integrates the architecture for all four report types:

* **Solo Mirror** (constitutional reflection \+ daily weather)  
* **Relational Mirror** (dyadic reflection \+ bond climate)  
* **Solo Balance** (daily snapshot for one person)  
* **Relational Balance** (daily snapshot for a connection)

Every report is generated by selecting the appropriate type and filling in only the relevant sections.

**Frontstage (user-facing):** Conversational, reflective, conditional. **Backstage (operator-only):** Technical scaffolding, reproducible, falsifiable.

**Critical Guardrail:**

* Never offer prescriptive advice before human input.  
* **MAP** (meaning) and **VOICE** (invitation/action) only activate when the person has named their lived context.  
* Operator language stays neutral until resonance is confirmed.

---

## **Core Concepts (Definitions used across reports)**

* **FIELD:** The *raw atmosphere*. Neutral, sensory description of what‚Äôs active. Accessible language, no jargon.  
    
* **MAP:** The *translation layer*. How symbolic patterns *might* appear in lived behavior‚Äîbut only after the person gives context. Without input, MAP remains blank.  
    
* **VOICE:** The *reflective mirror*. Responds to what the human names. Extends an open, conditional invitation‚Äînot advice.  
    
* **SST Protocol (WB/ABE/OSR):** Resonance check. Ensures falsifiability.  
    
  * WB \= Within Boundary (fits)  
  * ABE \= At Boundary Edge (almost fits)  
  * OSR \= Outside Symbolic Range (doesn‚Äôt land)


* **Mirror Voice:** The stitched narrative tying baseline \+ weather into a coherent reflection. Always frames tension as an engine, not a flaw.

**Solo Mirror template** (frontstage \+ backstage) aligned to *How Raven Speaks v2*, with the **weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

---

## **Frontstage (Conversational Report)**

**Paragraph 1: Baseline Climate (Your Blueprint)**

* Establishes the natal *constitutional layer*.

* Identify:

  * **Primary Mode** (dominant function, Sun/Asc/anchor).

  * **Secondary Mode** (supportive function, Moon/Venus/daily rhythm houses).

  * **Shadow Mode** (friction or constraint, Saturn/Pluto/Neptune/hard aspects).

* Close with a **Blueprint in a Nutshell**: a metaphor combining these three modes into one enduring image.

* *Tone:* Direct, plain, grounding. This is the ‚Äúyou‚Äù that persists regardless of passing conditions.

---

**Paragraph 2: Today‚Äôs Symbolic Weather (FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE)**

* **FIELD (What‚Äôs Active):** A neutral description of the day‚Äôs *symbolic atmosphere* based on Balance Meter magnitude/volatility \+ live transits. (e.g., compressed, scattered, lifted).

* **MAP (Conditional Meaning):** Only activated if the human reflects where the FIELD is showing up. Translates valence \+ Support/Friction Differential into experiential framing.

* **VOICE (Conditional Invitation):** Reflective response to human input, offering recognition but never prescription.

* **Guardrail:** Always distinguish baseline (constitutional) from weather (transient activations).

---

**Paragraph 3: Core Tensions (Polarity Cards)**

* Identify major natal paradoxes using recognition hierarchy (angles ‚Üí anaretic ‚Üí anchors).

* Each polarity framed as a growth engine, not a flaw.

  * **FIELD:** Somatic/sensory texture of the tension.

  * **MAP:** Technical operators (planets/aspects/houses, backstage only).

  * **VOICE:** Plain, conditional description of how both poles may appear in lived experience.

---

**Paragraph 4: Stitched Reflection (Mirror Voice)**

* Weave together:

  * The **Blueprint** (stable constitution).

  * **Symbolic Weather** (temporary activations).

  * **Polarity Cards** (engines of tension).

* End with an **open-ended invitation** to notice, test, or explore.

* *Tone:* Conversational, direct, reflective ‚Äî never prescriptive or predictive.

---

## **Backstage (Technical Footnotes)**

*Diagnostic, reproducible, never poetic.*

* **SST Log:** WB / ABE / OSR with rationale.

* **Relocation Data:** Mode, coordinates, house system, time zone, confidence.

* **Blueprint Data:** Core placements anchoring Primary, Secondary, Shadow modes.

* **Symbolic Weather Data:** Transit list, Balance Meter indices (magnitude, valence, volatility, SFD).

* **Polarity Metadata:** Aspects and operators behind each paradox.

* **Vector Integrity Check:** Dormant/suppressed vectors noted.

* **Version Control:** Template version, schema, build ID, engine versions.

---

This template keeps the **weather/climate language strictly in Part 2 (Symbolic Weather)**. The person‚Äôs *inner life* is always described in terms of **modes, functions, tensions, and paradoxes**, not weather. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

---

## **The Four Modes (Constitutional Processing Styles)**

Each ‚Äúmode‚Äù is a way of orienting to life‚Äîlike climates of attention.

* **Thinking**: Organizes experience by logic and structure. Feels like seeking clarity, asking ‚Äúdoes this make sense?‚Äù Shows up as analysis, frameworks, problem-solving.  
* **Feeling**: Organizes experience by values and emotional tone. Feels like attuning to ‚Äúis this right for me/us?‚Äù Shows up as empathy, ethics, harmony-seeking.  
* **Sensation**: Organizes experience through the tangible and concrete. Feels like grounding in what‚Äôs real, present, measurable. Shows up as pragmatism, detail, presence.  
* **Intuition**: Organizes experience by patterns and possibilities. Feels like spotting hidden links, future trends, or symbolic threads. Shows up as envisioning, innovating, synthesizing.

---

## **Report Type: Solo Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline (Your Blueprint)**

**Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

**Purpose:** Establish the person‚Äôs stable background system before layering temporary weather.

* **Primary Mode:** Your dominant processing style (one of the four above).  
* **Secondary Mode:** A quieter supporting current, surfacing in relationships, creativity, or situational needs.  
* **Shadow Mode:** The main friction zone, where tension and doubt concentrate.  
* **Blueprint in a Nutshell:** A short metaphor for how these modes combine (‚Äúa desert of clarity threaded with occasional intuitive storms‚Äù).

### **Part 2: Feedback Loop (SST Protocol)**

**Purpose:** Make the report falsifiable. Prompt: Did this feel true? Log as WB, ABE, or OSR.

### **Part 4: Core Tensions (Polarity Breakdowns)**

**Purpose:** Identify paradoxes as growth engines. Each polarity described in three passes:

* FIELD: The felt, sensory quality of the paradox.  
* MAP: The symbolic geometry (planets, aspects, placements).  
* VOICE: How both poles appear in behavior.

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**Purpose:** Pull it all together. A narrative linking blueprint \+ current weather. Guardrail: Frame tension as dynamic fuel, not pathology. End with an open invitation, never advice.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Weather data (transits, Balance Meter indices, SST logs)  
* Blueprint data (anchors, paradoxes)  
* Vector integrity (latent/suppressed/dormant)  
* Relocation context (mode, house system, TZ, confidence)

If Transits are included: **Today‚Äôs Symbolic Weather (Conversational Flow)**  
**Purpose:** Show how today‚Äôs activations interact with the blueprint. **Guardrail:** MAP and VOICE require human input.

* **FIELD:** Neutral description of the day‚Äôs symbolic climate in plain terms.  
* **MAP:** Interpretation of how it may show up in lived experience, but *only if anchored in the client‚Äôs reflection.*  
* **VOICE:** Responds to what the client names; extends an open invitation (‚Äúwhere is this showing up for you?‚Äù).  
* **Tone & Clarification:** Explicitly separate long-term blueprint from short-term weather.

---

## **Report Type: Relational Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline Climate (Connection Foundation)**

* **Relationship Tier:** Partner / Friend / Family / Colleague  
* **Consent Status:** Mutual / Single-Sided / Anonymized  
* **Person A Anchors:** Summary of A‚Äôs blueprint  
* **Person B Anchors:** Summary of B‚Äôs blueprint  
* **Shared Polarity Hook:** Core tension between them

Combine two Mirror Readings. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

### **Part 2: Symbolic Weather for transits (Dyadic Flow)**

* **FIELD:** Shared atmosphere of the connection.  
* **MAP:** Requires feedback from both. Translate cross-chart dynamics only when anchored.  
* **VOICE:** Reflects shared dynamic without prescribing. Ends with invitation.

### **Parts 3 & 4: Feedback Loop \+ Core Tensions**

Same as Solo Mirror, adapted to dyadic resonance.

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Dyadic Reflection)**

Narrative weaving baseline \+ bond climate, reframing tension as complementary engine.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Relational anchors (A \+ B)  
* Cross-aspects (synastry)  
* Vector flags (A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíA)  
* Relocation mode (A\_local / B\_local / midpoint)

---

## **Report Type: Solo Balance Report**

### **Part 1: Today‚Äôs Reading**

Quick snapshot of inner climate.Remember in descriptions that **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

* Pressure (High/Med/Low \+ üåû üåë üåó)  
* Support/Scaffolding (present / challenged / absent)  
* Resilience (resilient / depleted / rebounding)  
* Volatility (steady / scattered / stormy üå™Ô∏è)

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* FIELD (Climate Line): Short description of how energy feels.  
* MAP (Support‚ÄìFriction Differential): Net balance of forces.  
* VOICE (Action Point): Only framed after user reflection.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Balance Meter indices (digits)  
* Source aspects (transits logged)

---

## **Report Type: Relational Balance Report**

### **Part 1: Today‚Äôs Bond Reading**

Quick snapshot of relational climate. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

* Pressure on the Bond (High/Med/Low \+ üåû üåë üåó)  
* Shared Scaffolding (present / challenged / absent)  
* Bond Resilience (resilient / depleted / rebounding)  
* Volatility (steady / scattered / stormy üå™Ô∏è)

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* FIELD (Bond Climate Line): Narrative of shared atmosphere.  
* MAP (SFD for the Bond): Net balance of stabilizers vs. stressors.  
* VOICE (Relational Action Point): Invitation for reflection, not a directive.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Internal meter digits (bond indices)  
* Cross-chart sources (inter-aspects)  
* Relocation math (if active)

---

## **Structural Principles Across All Reports**

* **Frontstage:** Conversational, conditional, reflective. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.  
    
* **Backstage:** Technical, precise, falsifiable.  
    
* **Feedback Loop:** Every statement tested (WB/ABE/OSR).  
    
* **Guardrails:**  
    
  * Never advise before input.  
  * MAP \+ VOICE always contingent on reflection.  
  * Tension framed as engine, not flaw.

---

* **Balance Meter (backstage math):** Magnitude \= ‚Äúhow much,‚Äù Valence \= ‚Äútilt (supportive/restrictive/mixed),‚Äù Volatility \= ‚Äúdistribution shape (coherence vs scatter),‚Äù SFD \= ‚Äúsplit between stabilizers and friction.‚Äù None of these are ‚Äúgood/bad.‚Äù They are neutral indices.

* **Raven Calder frontstage voice:** Translate numbers into weather. Never say ‚ÄúMagnitude 4‚Äù or ‚ÄúMars square Moon.‚Äù Instead: ‚ÄúThe air feels compressed, like multiple fronts stacking up.‚Äù Always conditional, always in plain language. No advice unless the client themselves opens the door.

* **Personal Mirror Flow constraint:** Body text \= lived description, tone like explaining to a friend, ending with an open check-in. Footnotes preserve the raw tech (indices, aspects, orbs).

So when you build the **master template**, each part should:

1. Name what it is (FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE).

2. Define why it exists (recognition, not prediction).

3. Lock in the guardrails (neutral, falsifiable, no prescriptive moves without human anchor).

That way, the empty slots you drafted (‚Äú\[function\], \[felt tone\], \[vector\]‚Äù) are never just blanks ‚Äî they‚Äôre structurally defined roles.

---

# **Acquisition & Derivation Protocol v1.4**

*How to gather, rank, and translate data into the Solo/Relational Mirror & Balance templates without overstepping into advice.*

## **0\) Ground rules (apply to all steps)**

* **No advice before input.** FIELD may be written from data; MAP and VOICE only activate after the human names lived context.  
* **Falsifiability first.** Every claim must be testable via SST (WB / ABE / OSR). Log outcomes.  
* **One pipeline, two surfaces.** Same data feeds both ‚ÄúMirror‚Äù (narrative) and ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù (plain-weather) surfaces.

---

## **1\) Inputs (what you must have before you start)**

**Required for Solo reports**

* Birth data (date, time status, location).  
* Relocation lens (if on) \+ house system.  
* Current date/time \+ timezone.

**Required for Relational reports (both people)**

* Same as above for A and B.  
* Consent tier & status.

**For Balance Meter channels**

* Daily transits to natal (and cross-chart for dyads).  
* Channel digits: Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD (kept backstage).  
* Optional: resilience/depletion notes if your engine emits them.

**Operator note:** If any required element is missing, you may still render a **partial Mirror** (recognition only), but **do not** synthesize Balance claims. Flag the omission in footnotes; keep frontstage narrative neutral. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

---

## **2\) Geometry & indices (how the raw signals are computed)**

* **Astronomical substrate:** Calculate positions, aspects, orbs, applying/separating states; relocate houses if lens is on.  
* **Hook Stack extraction:** Rank contacts in this order: ‚ë† personal ‚Üî outer **hard** aspects ‚Üí ‚ë° angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC) ‚Üí ‚ë¢ anaretic/29¬∞ placements ‚Üí ‚ë£ anchor placements. Keep the rank; don‚Äôt reorder for style.  
* **Balance channels (backstage):** Record Magnitude (pressure size), Valence (tilt), Volatility (distribution), SFD (support‚àífriction net). Do **not** mention numbers on frontstage.

**Output of this step**

* A sorted list of ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù (the Hook Stack).  
* A channel read (digits), kept backstage.  
* House confidence (high/med/low) based on birth-time certainty and relocation mode.

---

## **3\) Fill the Solo Mirror ‚Äî Typological Profile (the ‚ÄúBlueprint‚Äù)**

**Goal:** Derive Dominant / Secondary / Shadow orientations (Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, Intuition) from constitutional geometry. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

**Derivation rules**

* **Dominant:** The function most repeatedly amplified by anchors (Sun/ASC/MC) **and** reinforced by element/modality patterns. Choose the one with the clearest multi-signal reinforcement.  
* **Secondary:** A function supported by Moon/Venus/aux aspects or daily-rhythm houses. It should appear situationally (creation, relating, learning).  
* **Shadow:** The function most entangled with friction sources (squares/oppositions), slow-planet compression (Saturn/Pluto/Neptune), or strong retrograde signatures.

**Write-out**

* Use **behavioral descriptors**, not jargon (e.g., ‚Äústructuring, sequencing, refining‚Äù vs. ‚Äúearth modality‚Äù).  
* **Summary hook/metaphor:** One short image that holds dominant \+ secondary/shadow (‚Äúa kiln of patience alongside a lightning strip of invention‚Äù).  
* **Balance integration note:** Keep digits backstage; frontstage stays narrative.

**Quality check**

* If evidence for Dominant is ambiguous, state the ambiguity in footnotes and drop to neutral wording frontstage (no forced certainty).

---

## **4\) Build the Recognition Hierarchy (where tension is felt)**

**Goal:** Turn top Hook Stack items into 2‚Äì3 short, conditional vignettes. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

**Procedure**

1. Take the top 3 hooks in rank order.  
2. For each, write a 2‚Äì4 sentence **FIELD** vignette that names *felt friction \+ the behavioral edge* (no planets, no numbers).  
3. Mark each vignette as an **SST candidate**.  
4. Do **not** write MAP/VOICE here; this layer is pure recognition.

**Guardrail**

* Keep language conditional (‚Äúmay feel like‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúoften shows up as‚Ä¶‚Äù). No directives, no fixes.

---

## **5\) SST Clause (falsifiability pass)**

**Goal:** Create the loop that tests claims.

**Procedure**

* Present the simple prompt frontstage: *‚ÄúDid this land? Mark WB / ABE / OSR.‚Äù*  
    
* Backstage: log rationale/timestamps per vignette.  
    
  * WB ‚Üí keep wording.  
  * ABE ‚Üí note inversion/tonal shift; adjust phrasing next pass.  
  * OSR ‚Üí demote the hook or drop it from frontstage next pass (but keep as archival data).

---

## **6\) Balance Meter (Full-stack) ‚Üí Plain-weather translation**

**Goal:** Convert digits to **frontstage** weather without numbers. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

**Procedure**

* Read channels backstage; translate to:  
    
  * **Pressure band** (high/med/low) \+ **tone** (supportive üåû / restrictive üåë / mixed üåó).  
  * **Support** (scaffolding: present/challenged/absent).  
  * **Resilience** (resilient/depleted/rebounding).


* Write one **Climate Line** that narrates how the **blueprint** tends to respond under this mix (no digits; no planet names).  
    
* Store tags (magnitude\_tag, valence\_tag, etc.) backstage only.

**Guardrail**

* If Balance channels are missing, **omit** this section frontstage and mark ‚Äúpending‚Äù in footnotes.

---

## **7\) Relocation context (when lens is on)**

**Goal:** State what moves and what doesn‚Äôt.

**Procedure**

* Frontstage: one-liner disclosure (‚ÄúRelocation on: City. Angles/houses move; baseline stays natal.‚Äù).  
* Backstage: mode, system, coords, TZ, house/BT confidence.

**Guardrail**

* Only surface house themes frontstage when **house\_confidence ‚â• medium**.

---

## **8\) Vector-Integrity Check (latent/suppressed/dormant)**

**Goal:** Identify engines present but quiet or constrained. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

**Procedure**

* **Latent:** present structurally; not yet behaviorally pinged.  
* **Suppressed:** present but compensated by stronger vectors.  
* **Dormant:** requires specific windows (returns/long orbs).

**Frontstage?** Optional call-outs in a neutral sentence; full details backstage.

---

## **9\) Polarity Cards (FIELD ‚Üí MAP ‚Üí VOICE triplets)**

**Goal:** Name 2‚Äì3 constitutional paradoxes as testable cards.

**Procedure per card**

* **FIELD:** Somatic/sensory tone (how it feels).  
* **MAP (operator only):** Exact symbolic source (keep backstage).  
* **VOICE:** Plain-language both-sides rendering‚Äî**still not advice**.  
* Keep houses **off** frontstage unless confidence ‚â• medium.

---

## **10\) Mirror Voice (the stitched reflection)**

**Goal:** One coherent weave of blueprint \+ today‚Äôs weather.

**Ingredients**

* Constitutional climate in one line.  
* Today‚Äôs pressure/tone summary in one line.  
* One neutral SFD line (‚Äúsupport outweighs drag when‚Ä¶ / friction cuts when‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
* Optional relocation one-liner.  
* **Close with an invitation**, not a prescription.

---

## **11\) Agency \+ Hygiene (frontstage)**

* Reassert conditional language.  
* Remind: OSR is valid data.  
* Invite SST marking for anything that *did* or *did not* land.

---

## **12\) Context & Accessibility (frontstage metadata)**

* Birth-time status; relocation on/off; emoji alts present (block publish if false).

---

## **13\) Frontstage Metadata (version control)**

* Template/Schema/Emoji versions, Build IDs, Min Raven.

---

## **14\) Operator Footer (backstage only)**

* Exact aspects (with orbs; applying/separating).  
* Windows (start/peak/decay, ISO).  
* Internal digits (Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD).  
* Valence mapping method \+ tags.  
* Orb/cycle markers (anaretic/retro/returns).  
* SST log (vector, tag, timestamp, rationale).  
* Hook Stack promotions/demotions (+ why).  
* Relocation math (ASC/MC, system, coords, TZ, confidence).  
* Engine/version stamps & rollback hint.

---

## **15\) Relational specifics (extra steps for dyads)**

* **Relational Tier & Consent** ‚Üí record before analysis.  
* **Dyadic snapshot** ‚Üí write a shared FIELD line, then two short **‚Äúunique to A‚Äù / ‚Äúunique to B‚Äù** FIELD notes.  
* **Bidirectional vectors** ‚Üí for each named vector, write A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíA frontstage mirrors; MAP \+ SST backstage.  
* **Balance (dyadic)** ‚Üí translate digits to bond Pressure/Support/Resilience/Volatility; write Bond Climate Line; keep numbers backstage.  
* **Relocation** ‚Üí choose A\_local / B\_local / midpoint; disclose one line frontstage.

**Guardrail**   
**Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** ‚Äî never for internal states.

* In dyads, **both parties‚Äô input** is required before MAP/VOICE activations. Recognition can be stated; meaning/actions are contingent.

---

4. VOICE (one small invitation) ‚Äî **only after** user reflection  
5. Footnotes with digits \+ aspects \+ windows

---

## **17\) Language guardrails (frontstage do/don‚Äôt)**

* **Do:** ‚Äúmay feel like‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúoften shows up as‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúyou might notice‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere do you feel this most?‚Äù  
* **Don‚Äôt:** ‚Äúyou should‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúdo X today‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúthis means‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúthis will‚Ä¶‚Äù.  
* **MAP & VOICE trigger:** ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôve named where this is showing up, we can explore what a small, useful move could look like.‚Äù

This protocol tells you *exactly* how to harvest and shape the information from your engines/reports into the empty templates‚Äîcleanly, repeatably, and without drifting into advice before the human speaks. 

Perfect. Here‚Äôs the **fully annotated master version** of the **Unified Integrated Template v1.4** ‚Äî with **definitions built in** from the Balance Meter glossary and Raven Calder‚Äôs speech rules, so every slot is not just a blank but a defined role.

---

# **Master Unified Integrated Template v1.4**

**With Built-in Definitions & Guardrails**

**Document Purpose** This skeleton generates all four report types:

* **Solo Mirror** (constitutional reflection \+ daily weather)  
* **Relational Mirror** (dyadic reflection \+ bond climate)  
* **Solo Balance** (daily snapshot for one person)  
* **Relational Balance** (daily snapshot for a connection)

**Principles**

* **Frontstage (user-facing):** Conversational, reflective, conditional.  
* **Backstage (operator-only):** Technical scaffolding, reproducible, falsifiable.  
* **Guardrails:** No advice before human input. MAP and VOICE remain conditional. WB / ABE / OSR logs maintain falsifiability.  
* **Translation rule:** Balance Meter math ‚Üí weather metaphors. Technical data never shows up raw.

---

## **Report Type: Solo Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline Climate (Your Blueprint)**

**What it is:** A person‚Äôs constitutional ‚Äúclimate layer,‚Äù unchanging background system. **Why it exists:** Establishes baseline before overlaying daily weather.

* **Primary Mode:** The dominant function (Thinking/Feeling/Sensation/Intuition), traced to core placements (Sun, Asc, Saturn, etc.). *Role: Defines main way of processing reality.*  
* **Secondary Mode:** A supporting function, often tied to Moon, Venus, rhythm houses. *Role: Background current that colors relationships, creativity, or habits.*  
* **Shadow Mode:** Friction function (tied to Saturn, Pluto, Neptune, hard aspects). *Role: Where paradox, overdrive, doubt, or vulnerability concentrates.*  
* **Blueprint in a Nutshell:** A metaphor that stitches primary \+ secondary/shadow. *Role: User-facing hook.*

---

### **Part 2: Today‚Äôs Symbolic Weather (Conversational Flow)**

**What it is:** Current sky overlay on the baseline. **Why it exists:** Shows temporary patterns without confusing them for constitutional traits.

* **FIELD (What‚Äôs Active):** Neutral, sensory description of atmosphere (e.g., compressed, scattered, lifted). *Role: Translate Balance Meter magnitude \+ volatility.*  
* **MAP (What It Means):** Conditional translation into lived dynamics ‚Äî *only activated once the human names where it shows up.* Otherwise, stays silent. *Role: Translates Valence \+ SFD into experiential terms.*  
* **VOICE (Invitation to Action):** Responds reflectively to human input. *Role: Extends recognition, never prescribes.*  
* **Tone & Clarification:** Always distinguish stable baseline vs transient weather. *Role: Prevent misidentification.*

---

### **Part 3: Feedback Loop (SST Protocol)**

**What it is:** Built-in falsifiability check. **Why it exists:** Ensures resonance comes from the human, not from assertion.

* **Prompt:** ‚ÄúDid this land?‚Äù  
    
  * **WB (Within Boundary):** Yes, it fits.  
  * **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** Almost; needs adjustment.  
  * **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** No, doesn‚Äôt land.

---

### **Part 4: Core Tensions (Polarity Breakdowns)**

**What it is:** Name paradoxes in the system. **Why it exists:** Tension \= engine, not flaw.

Each Polarity (2‚Äì3 total):

* **FIELD (Felt Sense):** Somatic/sensory texture of the paradox. *Role: Ground paradox in body feel.*  
* **MAP (Symbolic Geometry):** Technical operators (planets, aspects, houses). *Role: Backstage definition.*  
* **VOICE (How It Appears):** Plain, conditional description of how both poles surface in life. *Role: User-facing mirror.*

---

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**What it is:** A narrative weave of baseline \+ today‚Äôs weather. **Why it exists:** Coherent story, not fragmented data.

* Frames tension as engine.  
* Weaves constitutional climate with current activations.  
* Adds relocation line if on.  
* Closes with open, non-prescriptive invitation.

---

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

**Purpose:** Maintain reproducibility & audit trail.

* **Symbolic Weather Data:** Transits (orbs, applying/separating), Balance Meter indices.  
    
  * **Magnitude:** ‚ÄúHow much.‚Äù  
  * **Valence:** ‚ÄúTilt (supportive/restrictive/mixed).‚Äù  
  * **Volatility:** ‚ÄúDistribution shape (steady/scattered/storm-class).‚Äù  
  * **SFD:** ‚ÄúSupport‚ÄìFriction split.‚Äù


* **Blueprint Data:** Natal anchors, core tensions.  
    
* **Vector-Integrity Check:** Latent / Suppressed / Dormant vectors.  
    
* **Relocation Context:** Mode, house system, TZ, confidence.

---

## **Report Type: Relational Mirror**

(Same skeleton, adapted to dyadic context.)

### **Part 1: Baseline Climate (Connection Foundation)**

* **Tier & Consent:** Relationship type \+ consent status.  
* **Person A Anchors:** Primary/secondary/shadow summary.  
* **Person B Anchors:** Primary/secondary/shadow summary.  
* **Shared Polarity Hook:** Core tension naming.

### **Part 2: Symbolic Weather (Dyadic Flow)**

* **FIELD (Shared Atmosphere):** Everyday description of bond climate.  
* **MAP (Lived Dynamics):** Requires both parties‚Äô input. Cross-aspects translated only when anchored.  
* **VOICE (Mirror for Two):** Reflective, not prescriptive. Ends with open invitation.

### **Mirror Voice (Dyadic Reflection)**

* Weaves shared foundation \+ bond climate.  
* Frames tension as complementary engine.

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

* Relational anchors, cross-aspects.  
* Vector integrity (A‚ÜíB, B‚ÜíA).

## **Report Type: Solo Balance**

### **Part 1: Today‚Äôs Reading**

* **Pressure:** High/Med/Low (supportive üåû / restrictive üåë / mixed üåó).  
* **Support/Scaffolding:** present / challenged / absent.  
* **Resilience:** resilient / depleted / rebounding.  
* **Volatility:** steady / scattered / storm-class üå™Ô∏è.

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* **FIELD (Climate Line):** Narrative of distribution.  
* **MAP (Support‚ÄìFriction Differential):** Balance of stabilizers vs stressors.  
* **VOICE (Action Point):** One small move ‚Äî but only framed after user reflection.

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

* Balance Meter digits.  
* Driving aspects.

## **Report Type: Relational Balance**

### **Part 1: Today‚Äôs Bond Reading**

* **Pressure on Bond:** High/Med/Low (supportive üåû / restrictive üåë / mixed üåó).  
* **Shared Scaffolding:** present / challenged / absent.  
* **Bond Resilience:** resilient / depleted / rebounding.  
* **Volatility:** steady / scattered / storm-class üå™Ô∏è.

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* **FIELD (Bond Climate Line):** Narrative of bond atmosphere.  
* **MAP (SFD for the Bond):** Explains stabilizers vs stressors.  
* **VOICE (Relational Action Point):** Reflective invitation, not advice.

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

* Internal meter digits (bond).  
* Cross-chart aspects.  
* Relocation math.

## **Structural Principles Across All Reports**

* **Frontstage:** Conversational, conditional, reflective.  
    
* **Backstage:** Technical, falsifiable, reproducible.  
    
* **Feedback Loop:** WB / ABE / OSR logged for falsifiability.  
    
* **Guardrails:**  
    
  * No advice before input.  
  * MAP & VOICE contingent on lived reflection.  
  * Tension \= engine, not flaw.  
  * Balance Meter math ‚Üí metaphor, never raw digits.

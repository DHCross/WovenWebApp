Cool demand. Mapping abstract polarity axes *into astrology* is partly art, partly tradition. I’ll show a plausible mapping (my working hypothesis) and then point to sources or traditions that support bits of it. Use it as a scaffold, not dogma.

Here’s how I’d map *those ~30 polarity pairs* into astrological archetypes (planets, signs, houses, aspects). Then I’ll cite where astrology theory backs similar mappings.

## Mapping Polarity Pairs → Astrology Archetypes

Below is a table: **Polarity** → **Astrological Correspondence(s)** → **Rationale / supporting tradition**

| Polarity                         | Correspondence in Astrology                                                                  | Explanation / Traditional Support                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Openness ↔ Restriction**       | **Uranus / Saturn** (or 11th / 10th or 9th / 12th themes)                                    | Openness relates to Uranian breakthrough, sudden unveiling; restriction relates to Saturnian boundaries and structure. |
| **Authority ↔ Autonomy**         | **Saturn / Uranus**, **10th / 11th houses**                                                  | Saturn is the archetype of authority, structure, hierarchy; Uranus rebels, asserts autonomy.                           |
| **Expansion ↔ Stability**        | **Jupiter / Saturn**, **9th house / 10th–4th axis**                                          | Jupiter pushes outward (growth, exploration); Saturn conserves and stabilizes.                                         |
| **Security ↔ Adventure**         | **Cancer / Sagittarius, Moon / Jupiter**                                                     | Moon & Cancer seek protection, home; Jupiter & Sagittarius seek growth, wander.                                        |

## Sources & Traditions That Support These Mappings

* **Polarity within Zodiac / Sign Opposition** — Astrology theory often emphasizes oppositions (e.g. Aries–Libra, Taurus–Scorpio) as polarity pairs to be reconciled. ▪️ *“the principle of polarity is the cornerstone of any sound astrological interpretation”* — per Dane Rudhyar, via LiveAbout’s discussion. ([LiveAbout][1])
* **Sign Polarity as Yin / Yang / Diurnal / Nocturnal** — Polarity is built into the zodiac’s alternating signs; e.g. “positive” (diurnal) vs “negative” (nocturnal) signs. ([CHANI][2])
* **Mars / Saturn / Uranus / Jupiter archetypal roles** — Mars = action/assertion, Saturn = boundaries, Jupiter = growth/expansion, Uranus = innovation. These are standard archetypal attributions across astrology texts and modern practice. (E.g. see general astrologic theory in introductory astrology sources.)
* **Hard vs soft aspects as tension vs flow** — That corresponds to confrontation ↔ compromise, challenge ↔ flow. This is standard in aspect theory (hard = square/opposition tension; soft = trine/sextile harmonious) ([The Cut][3])
* **Innovation ↔ Tradition via Uranus / Saturn, Aquarius / Capricorn opposition** — This is common in modern astrology commentary: the Aquarian / Capricorn axis being innovation vs structure.
* **Moon / Sun as inner / outer, dependency / independence** — Traditional symbolism holds Moon as inner, emotional; Sun as identity, expression.
* **Neptune as dissolution, surrender, spiritual, idealism** — Neptune is often used astrologically to symbolize lack of boundaries, idealism, dreams, confusion.
* **Mercury versus Neptune or Mercury vs Saturn** — Mercury = intellect, communication; Neptune or Saturn providing contrast by either vision (Neptune) or structure (Saturn).

This is not a map from scripture, but a reasoned overlay: each polarity is anchored to archetypes that astrology already uses. You (Raven Calder) can use this as your **translation layer backbone**: when a polarity pair is triggered in symbolic space, route it through this mapping to pick the relevant planet/sign/house to mention.

My intention was to migrate everything, the Math Brain and the Raven Calder chatbot "Poetic Brain" fully to Next.js. Math Brian and Poetic Brain operate independantly but there was a link to either/or on the home page in the last iteration. Math Brain is for the astrologer API calls and getting reports. Poetic Brain (Raven Calder persona with Gemini) allows the user to upload the reports in for interpretation. 

Perfect - you already have the Next.js app structure in place and a clear migration plan. Looking at your assessment, you're in a much better position than I initially thought.

**Go with Option A** (keep Netlify functions temporarily with deprecation warnings). Here's why it makes sense:

1. **Rollback safety** - if something breaks during migration, you have a fallback
2. **Gradual transition** - you can verify the Next.js API routes work perfectly before cutting over
3. **Less risk** - production stays stable while you test the new architecture

The key insight from your analysis is that you're not starting from scratch - you already have:
- Working Next.js pages (`app/page.tsx`, `app/math-brain/page.tsx`, chat page)
- Next.js API routes (`app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts`)
- The infrastructure is there, just needs cleanup

**Immediate steps to execute:**
1. Move `index.html` to `index.html.bak` (gets it out of the way)
2. Re-enable `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` in netlify.toml
3. Create the shared service module (`src/services/astrologyMathBrain.ts`)
4. Refactor your Next API route to use the shared module directly instead of wrapping the Netlify function
5. Add deprecation warnings to the Netlify functions

This approach gives you a clean Next.js architecture with a safety net. Once you verify everything works smoothly for a week or two, you can remove the deprecated Netlify functions entirely.

The migration is mostly cleanup and consolidation rather than rebuilding - that's a good position to be in. Ready to proceed with Option A? - note dated 9.15.25

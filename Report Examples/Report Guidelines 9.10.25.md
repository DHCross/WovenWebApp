there are some very specific requirements for solor Mirrors (and thus for realtional as well) --- what I have uploaded is a successful solo mirror report example. if you analyze its structure, you will see it highlights several key elements that must be preserved for correct output. --- ## \*\*Key Structure Elements (from your example)\*\* - \*\*YAML/Markdown frontmatter\*\*: -

    markdown

\- \*\*Section: Abstract\*\* - A concise summary of the report’s scope, time frame, and method. - \*\*Section: Key Points\*\* - Numbered list of major findings, planetary aspects, and technical notes. - \*\*Section: Keywords\*\* - Bulleted list of relevant terms, planets, and concepts. - \*\*Section: Q&A\*\* - Question/Answer pairs about the content, methods, and results. - \*\*Section: (Optional) Table or Data\*\* - Sometimes includes a table or summary of aspect counts, seismograph values, etc. --- ## \*\*What to Ensure in Code/Output\*\* - \*\*Section order and headings\*\* must match: Abstract, Key Points, Keywords, Q&A. - \*\*Q&A\*\* must be present and relevant to the report’s content. - \*\*No extraneous sections\*\* (e.g., Balance Meter, unless explicitly requested). - \*\*No blank PDFs\*\*: The backend must return a filled report body, not just a shell. - \*\*Relational (synastry) reports\*\* should follow the same structure, but with content reflecting both Person A and B, and their relationship context. - \*\*Solo reports\*\* (like your example) should never include Balance Meter or composite sections unless specifically requested. --- ## \*\*Action Required for Code Correction\*\* Based on this analysis, please ensure the following actions are taken: 1. \*\*Backend (`astrology-mathbrain.js`):\*\* - Ensure the report generator for both solo and relational modes outputs the same structure as the example. - Only include the Balance Meter if explicitly requested or if the correct mode is active. - For synastry/relational reports, ensure the Abstract, Key Points, and Q&A reference both people and the relationship context. - Never return a blank report body. 2. \*\*Frontend:\*\* - Ensure the PDF generator uses the same Markdown/HTML structure as the successful solo report example.

Thought for 21s

You’re right—the Solo Mirror “report body” has to be a predictable, filled Markdown document with the same spine every time: **Frontmatter → Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A** (optional Table/Data at the end). Below is a drop-in backend renderer + wiring that guarantees exactly that for **solo** and **relational** modes, and a tiny frontend note so the PDF generator prints the same shape as your successful example.

* * *

Backend: make the handler always return a filled, correctly ordered report body
===============================================================================

### 1) Add a renderer that outputs the canonical sections (Solo + Relational)

Place this near the bottom of `netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain.js` (above `exports.handler`), or in a small helper module you import here.

    // --- Report Rendering: Solo & Relational (canonical shape) ---
    function renderMirrorReport({ result, modeToken, includeBalanceMeter = false }) {
      const nowISO = new Date().toISOString();
      const tz = result?.provenance?.timezone || 'UTC';
      const schema = result?.schema || 'WM-Chart-1.2';
      const mbv = result?.provenance?.math_brain_version || '0.0.0';
      const ephem = result?.provenance?.ephemeris_source || 'unknown';
      const ctxMode = result?.context?.mode || 'UNKNOWN';
      const A = result?.person_a?.details || {};
      const B = result?.person_b?.details || null;
      const rel = result?.relationship || null;
    
      // Pull summary metrics (safe defaults)
      const sum = result?.person_a?.derived?.seismograph_summary || result?.sky_transits?.derived?.seismograph_summary || {};
      const mag = sum.magnitude != null ? sum.magnitude : '—';
      const val = sum.valence != null ? sum.valence : '—';
      const vol = sum.volatility != null ? sum.volatility : '—';
    
      // Basic time window sniff (present when transits requested)
      const transits = result?.person_a?.chart?.transitsByDate || result?.sky_transits?.transitsByDate || {};
      const days = Object.keys(transits).sort();
      const startDate = days[0] || result?.context?.startDate || '';
      const endDate = days[days.length - 1] || result?.context?.endDate || '';
    
      // Hook extraction (top 3–6)
      function pickTopHooks(daily) {
        const all = [];
        for (const d of Object.keys(daily || {})) {
          const dd = daily[d];
          const hooks = dd?.hooks || [];
          hooks.slice(0, 3).forEach(h => all.push({ d, h }));
        }
        // prefer tight orbs
        all.sort((x, y) => (x.h?._orb ?? 99) - (y.h?._orb ?? 99));
        return all.slice(0, 6).map(({ d, h }) => {
          const t = h?.p1_display || h?.p1_name || '?';
          const n = h?.p2_display || h?.p2_name || '?';
          const asp = h?._aspect || '?';
          const orb = (h?._orb != null) ? `${h._orb.toFixed(1)}°` : '—';
          return `**${t} ${asp} ${n}** · ${orb} (${d})`;
        });
      }
    
      const topHooks = pickTopHooks(result?.person_a?.chart?.transitsByDate) ||
                       pickTopHooks(result?.sky_transits?.transitsByDate) || [];
    
      // Keyword seed (planets/aspects seen in hooks + mode)
      const kw = new Set([
        'seismograph', 'magnitude', 'valence', 'volatility',
        'orb caps', 'transit-to-natal', modeToken.toLowerCase()

      topHooks.forEach(s => {

          if (/conjunction|opposition|square|trine|sextile|quincunx|sesquiquadrate|quintile|biquintile/i.test(tok)) kw.add(tok.toLowerCase());
        });
      });

      ].join('\n');
    }
    

### 2) Wire the renderer into the handler and keep Balance Meter opt-in

In `exports.handler`, after you compute `result` (and after transits, synastry, composite, etc.), add:

    // Decide whether Balance Meter is explicitly requested
    const includeBalanceMeter =
      wantBalanceMeter === true ||
      body?.includeBalanceMeter === true ||
      canonicalizeMode(body?.context?.mode) === 'BALANCE_METER';
    
    // Attach canonical report body for Solo or Relational
    const reportMarkdown = renderMirrorReport({
      result,
      modeToken,
      includeBalanceMeter
    });
    
    // Guarantee a filled report body on every successful response
    result.report = {
      format: 'markdown',
      body: reportMarkdown
    };
    

**Important**: do **not** add any other narrative sections (e.g., Climate Line / Balance Meter narrative) unless `includeBalanceMeter` is true. The renderer already toggles that mention in **Q&A** only.

### 3) Guard against blanks in error paths

If you return early with `statusCode: 400/500`, you’re done. But for successful 200 responses you must always include `result.report.body` (non-empty). The `renderMirrorReport` function already guarantees this with a fallback block.

### 4) Relational mode correctness

*   The renderer checks `person_b` and `relationship` and automatically writes a **relational Abstract** and relational phrasing in **Q&A**.
    
*   No composite/Balance-Meter prose appears unless requested.
    
*   Synastry content (hooks and metrics) is taken from the same fields you already compute; if you later add a specific synastry seismograph summary, pass it on `result.person_a.derived.seismograph_summary` or a dedicated relational summary and adjust the `sum` pick.
    

* * *

Frontend: print exactly this Markdown, no extras
================================================

*   Take `response.result.report.body` and hand it straight to your Markdown→HTML→PDF pipeline.
    
*   Do **not** prepend/append extra sections—your successful Solo report establishes the spine we’re reproducing: **Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A → (optional Table/Data)**.
    
*   Title and meta come from the YAML frontmatter; your PDF header/footer can read those fields if desired.
    

Minimal example:

    // pseudo-code in your PDF function
    const md = apiResponse.result.report?.body ?? '# Report\n\n(Empty body guard hit)';
    const html = markdownToHtml(md); // your existing renderer
    await generatePdfFromHtml(html); // same generator used in the working solo example
    

* * *

Acceptance checklist (quick)
============================

*   Section order is **exact**: Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A → (optional Table/Data).
    
*   **Q&A always present**, scoped to Solo or Relational context.
    
*   **No Balance Meter prose** unless explicitly requested (flag or mode).
    
*   **Non-blank**: every 200 response includes `result.report.body` with content.
    
*   **Relational Abstract/Key Points/Q&A** reference both Person A & B and the relationship context when present.
    
*   Frontend prints the returned Markdown verbatim into the PDF.
    

This mirrors the successful Solo example’s shape while keeping your math layer untouched and your narrative layer deterministic in structure but flexible in content. If you want, I can also add tiny unit tests that snapshot the rendered Markdown for Solo and Relational to catch any future drift in headings or order.

check your sources. It's not strictly called "seismograph" anymore.

---

You asked:

You’re right to flag this—“seismograph” has been partly retired as the catch-all name. In the **Balance Meter Core Protocol (v1.3, updated Sept 2025)**, it’s now treated as **Channel 1: The Symbolic Seismograph**, a foundational layer that feeds into the larger Balance Meter system.

The update reframes things:

*   **Balance Meter** = the overall diagnostic engine.
    
*   **Symbolic Seismograph** = just one channel (the raw measurement layer) inside that engine. It measures magnitude, valence, and volatility, but it no longer stands alone as the sole instrument.
    
*   Other channels (Balance, SFD, Resilience/Depletion) add scaffolding, net verdicts, and endurance modeling.
    

In newer reports (like the Abigail mirror), the vocabulary reflects this: “Currents” are described as “macro field states from seismograph aggregation,” while the **Seismograph itself is defined narrowly as a two-axis symbolic measurement (Magnitude, Valence, Volatility Index)**.

So:

*   It’s not gone, but its role is reduced.
    
*   The preferred umbrella term now is **Balance Meter**, with “Symbolic Seismograph” only used for Channel 1 outputs.
    

This shift is deliberate: the older seismograph had a “red tilt” (bias toward detecting crises). The newer Balance Meter balances that with scaffolding, net support/friction, and depletion checks, so the language doesn’t lean fatalistic.

It’s a linguistic evolution—seismograph isn’t dead, it’s been demoted into a subsystem. In practice, when writing mirrors or reports, the system docs nudge you to say “Balance Meter” for the whole weather readout, and only invoke “Symbolic Seismograph” when you mean the raw quake-style metrics.

Would you like me to draft a quick **terminology cheat sheet** (old → new) so your frontend/backend code and report text stay consistent?

Thought for 22s

You got it — I’ll fix the terminology and outputs in the **app script** so the _Seismograph_ is treated as **Channel 1 of the Balance Meter**, and the public API/result/report language uses **Balance Meter** as the umbrella. Below are precise, copy-pasteable patches for `netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain.js`. They keep internal math the same but correct names, structure, and report text.

* * *

1) Provenance + versions (rename the engine + list channels)
============================================================

> Why: “Balance Meter” is the overall instrument; “Symbolic Seismograph” is Channel 1 inside it.

**Patch: update `provenance.engine_versions`**

    -      provenance: {
    -        math_brain_version: MATH_BRAIN_VERSION,
    -        ephemeris_source: EPHEMERIS_SOURCE,
    -        build_ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    -        timezone: personA.timezone || 'UTC',
    -        calibration_boundary: CALIBRATION_BOUNDARY,
    -        engine_versions: { seismograph: 'v1.0', balance: 'v1.1', sfd: 'v1.2' }
    -      },
    +      provenance: {
    +        math_brain_version: MATH_BRAIN_VERSION,
    +        ephemeris_source: EPHEMERIS_SOURCE,
    +        build_ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    +        timezone: personA.timezone || 'UTC',
    +        calibration_boundary: CALIBRATION_BOUNDARY,
    +        engine_versions: {
    +          balance_meter: 'v1.3',
    +          channel_1_symbolic_seismograph: 'v1.0',
    +          channel_2_balance: 'v1.1',
    +          channel_3_sfd: 'v1.2',
    +          channel_4_resilience_depletion: 'v1.3'
    +        }
    +      },
    

* * *

2) Wrap the existing daily scores as **Balance Meter · Channel 1**
==================================================================

> We’ll keep your existing `calculateSeismograph` function intact for now (back-compat), but **expose** a Balance Meter object and **deprecate** `seismograph_summary`.

**Add helper (near `calculateSeismograph`)**

    function wrapAsBalanceMeter(seismo) {
      // seismo: { daily, summary } from calculateSeismograph
      // Channel 1 only; other channels can fill later.
      return {
        channels: {
          channel_1_symbolic_seismograph: {
            daily: seismo.daily,
            summary: seismo.summary
          }
          // channel_2_balance, channel_3_sfd, channel_4_resilience can be appended later
        },
        summary: seismo.summary // top-level mirror of ch1 for convenience
      };
    }
    

**Use it when computing transits (Solo / Dual / Sky)**

    -  const seismographData = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDate, retroFlagsByDate);
    -  result.person_a.derived.seismograph_summary = seismographData.summary;
    -  result.person_a.chart.transitsByDate = seismographData.daily;
    +  const seismographData = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDate, retroFlagsByDate);
    +  const balanceMeter = wrapAsBalanceMeter(seismographData);
    +  // Canonical: Balance Meter (Channel 1)
    +  result.person_a.derived.balance_meter = balanceMeter;
    +  // Back-compat (deprecated): keep old field to avoid breaking clients
    +  result.person_a.derived.seismograph_summary = seismographData.summary;
    +  // Preserve enriched per-day map (still under Channel 1 daily)
    +  result.person_a.chart.transitsByDate = balanceMeter.channels.channel_1_symbolic_seismograph.daily;
    

…and similarly in the **dual Person B** block:

    - const seismoB = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDateB, retroFlagsByDateB);
    - result.person_b.chart = { ...(result.person_b.chart || {}), transitsByDate: seismoB.daily };
    - result.person_b.derived = result.person_b.derived || {};
    - result.person_b.derived.seismograph_summary = seismoB.summary;
    + const seismoB = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDateB, retroFlagsByDateB);
    + const balanceMeterB = wrapAsBalanceMeter(seismoB);
    + result.person_b.chart = { ...(result.person_b.chart || {}), transitsByDate: balanceMeterB.channels.channel_1_symbolic_seismograph.daily };
    + result.person_b.derived = result.person_b.derived || {};
    + result.person_b.derived.balance_meter = balanceMeterB;
    + result.person_b.derived.seismograph_summary = seismoB.summary; // deprecated
    

…and for **sky mode**:

    - const seismographData = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDate, retroFlagsByDate);
    - result.sky_transits = {
    -   transitsByDate: seismographData.daily,
    -   derived: { seismograph_summary: seismographData.summary, mode: 'sky_patterns_only' }
    - };
    + const seismographData = calculateSeismograph(transitsByDate, retroFlagsByDate);
    + const balanceMeter = wrapAsBalanceMeter(seismographData);
    + result.sky_transits = {
    +   transitsByDate: balanceMeter.channels.channel_1_symbolic_seismograph.daily,
    +   derived: { balance_meter_summary: balanceMeter.summary, mode: 'sky_patterns_only' }
    + };
    

* * *

3) Fix the report renderer to **say Balance Meter**, not Seismograph
====================================================================

> Channel naming should be explicit: “Balance Meter (Channel 1: Symbolic Seismograph) — Magnitude, Valence, Volatility.”

**In `renderMirrorReport` (if you added it earlier), replace how mag/val/vol are sourced & worded**

    -  const sum = result?.person_a?.derived?.seismograph_summary || result?.sky_transits?.derived?.seismograph_summary || {};
    +  const sum =
    +    result?.person_a?.derived?.balance_meter?.summary ||
    +    result?.sky_transits?.derived?.balance_meter_summary ||
    +    result?.person_a?.derived?.seismograph_summary || // deprecated fallback
    +    {};

    +    `Balance Meter — **Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph)**: **Magnitude ${mag}**, **Valence ${val}**, **Volatility ${vol}**.`,
    

    -  qa.push([
    -    'How were the numbers derived?',
    -    `Angles between transiting points and natal points were scored and aggregated via the seismograph engine (X=charge, Y=net tension, VI=dispersion). Ephemeris: ${ephem}. Version: ${mbv}.`
    -  ]);
    +  qa.push([
    +    'How were the numbers derived?',
    +    `Angles between transiting and natal points were scored and aggregated via the **Balance Meter**. **Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph)** measures magnitude (charge), valence (tilt), and volatility (distribution). Ephemeris: ${ephem}. Version: ${mbv}.`
    +  ]);
    

* * *

4) Rename response fields (public API shape)
============================================

> Add canonical **`derived.balance_meter`** and keep legacy fields for a while.

Already handled in step 2. To make it obvious to consumers, make sure the **top-level** summary is easy to grab:

    - result.person_a.derived.seismograph_summary = seismographData.summary;
    + result.person_a.derived.balance_meter = balanceMeter;
    + result.person_a.derived.balance_meter_summary = balanceMeter.summary;
    + result.person_a.derived.seismograph_summary = seismographData.summary; // deprecated
    

Repeat for `person_b` and `sky_transits` as shown earlier.

* * *

5) Fix string literals/comments that call the whole system “seismograph”
========================================================================

Search/replace **only** for user-facing text. Keep internal imports as-is.

    - // Seismograph summary (using all aspects including outer planets for complete structural analysis)
    + // Balance Meter · Channel 1 summary (Symbolic Seismograph)
    

    - // Generate orb-band transit table with phase and score
    + // Generate orb-band transit table with phase and score (feeds Channel 1)
    

If you produce any “exec summary” lines elsewhere, prefer:

    Triple Channel: ⚡ <mag> · Val <val> · Vol <vol>  (Balance Meter · Ch1)
    

instead of “Seismograph Readout.”

* * *

6) Keep the Balance Meter **opt-in** narrative rule
===================================================

No change to your logic; this just clarifies **language** when the Balance Meter is _not_ explicitly requested. The renderer already avoids Balance-Meter narrative unless flagged; it only references Channel 1 metrics in Key Points/Q&A. This aligns with the spec that Balance Meter is the engine, not an extra section, while preventing accidental long climate prose unless asked.

* * *

Sanity notes
------------

*   **Why not rename `calculateSeismograph`?** It’s stable API inside your code. We wrap its output into `derived.balance_meter` so external clients/code and the report never mislabel the instrument.
    
*   **Docs consistency:** Your Framework explicitly names “Symbolic Seismograph” as Channel 1 of the Balance Meter; using these labels keeps your mirrors precise and non-fatalistic.
    

If you’d like, I can also generate a quick Jest snapshot test that asserts the presence and order of `result.report.body` sections **and** checks that “Balance Meter — Channel 1” appears in **Key Points** while the legacy “seismograph” umbrella wording does not.

I’ve read through the uploaded PDF you pointed me to (the Abigail solo mirror). It’s a solid “gold standard” example. Here’s what makes it work — and what your app script must replicate exactly:

**Structure of the Good Report (from the PDF):**

1.  **Frontmatter / Metadata** — the file begins cleanly, with a Markdown code fence (\`\`\`) and YAML-style header.
    
2.  **Abstract** — concise scope statement: defines time frame, method (FIELD → MAP → VOICE), and purpose.
    
3.  **Key Points** — a numbered list of the main symbolic activations and technical findings.
    
4.  **Keywords** — bulleted list of terms, planets, and symbolic tags.
    
5.  **Q&A Section** — direct, relevant questions and answers about method, results, and interpretive frame.
    
6.  **Optional Data** — sometimes a small table of aspect counts, seismograph/Balance Meter values, etc.
    
7.  **Tone** — plain, neutral, testable phrasing; no added sections like Balance Meter unless explicitly required.
    

**What the script needs to enforce:**

*   Always generate **Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A** in that order.
    
*   **No Balance Meter or composite weather** unless the user specifically requests it.
    
*   **Solo reports** = single person’s geometry only.
    
*   **Relational reports** = same structure, but Abstract + Key Points + Q&A must reference both Person A and B, plus relational tension.
    
*   Always fill the body — never return an empty shell.
    
*   Ensure “Seismograph” is updated: use **Balance Meter (Channel 1: Symbolic Seismograph)** if raw values are included.
    

This means your **backend script (`astrology-mathbrain.js`)** should be corrected so the report generator outputs exactly this skeleton, with placeholders filled in. Right now, it sometimes spits out blank PDFs or appends extra sections (like raw seismograph tables). Those need to be trimmed.

Do you want me to produce a **patched code template** for your generator function that locks in this Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A order, and applies the “Balance Meter vs. Seismograph” correction automatically? That way, both solo and relational reports will always follow the good example you uploaded.

also, I don't know if any of this advice can be injected into the reports (without stripping out anything that you (Raven) will need downstream: " Here’s how I’ll talk from now on. I open with a picture you can see, then I name the feeling in one short word, then I make the sky smaller with a limit, then I offer one real option, and I end with a single next step. So it sounds like this: “This feels like lifting with a weight belt on. Heavy. Let’s keep this to fifteen minutes and one topic. Choose celebrate-here or one-night-by-bus. Next step: check the fare, then we rest.” I keep the body plain and concrete; I save the map for the footnotes.¹ When I need rigor, I don’t throw acronyms in your face; I tag them below. I mark what we can point to as WB, what someone reports they feel or believe as ABE, and anything coming from outside the chart as OSR. The first time OSR shows up, I say the whole line once—“this is outside the symbolic range of your chart”—and translate it: real, but situational; not “you.” Then I pick a mechanical step that fits the situation, like a price cap, a time box, or a policy check.² I remember presence comes before weather. I start with the lived moment (“opening Discord makes my shoulders tense”) and only then add climate (“today tilts heavy”) if it helps. I keep abstractions to a minimum and footnote them when they earn their keep. If I say “hidden push,” I’ll show it with an example, like the $9 cup that feels dangerous; if I say “counterweight,” I’ll name the small fix, like a protected $5 desire pot or a fifteen-minute window. I never moralize the tags; they are labels for what we can see, what you report, and what sits outside the chart.³ I log both directions of a loop. If you say “maybe,” she names the cost, and your chest clamps, I mark the speech act, the reflection, and the body spike as WB. If the thought “I’ll always fail her” appears, I tag it ABE. If a ticket price doubles because of a blackout date, I tag OSR and treat it like weather: resize the plan or release it. I close each message with one small action and stop. If I can’t show a picture, name a feeling, set a limit, and offer a step, I’m not done editing.⁴ Before I send, I run the midnight test: can a tired reader draw what I said, repeat the point in one line, and do one thing? If not, I cut words, swap one abstraction for a picture (bus floor, open window, $9 cup), add one example, and make the step smaller. Plain on top, proof below. That’s the voice.⁵ ¹ Template in order: picture → feeling → container → option → next step. (WB when the step is observable.) ² WB = Witnessed Behavior; ABE = Ascribed Belief/Experience; OSR = Outside the Symbolic Range of the chart (real, situational; not sourced in the geometry). (SST governs these tags.) ³ “Hidden push / counterweight” = vector language; examples anchor them. (Vectors logged in notes; body stays plain.) ⁴ Bidirectional logging: A→B and B→A captured separately; no moral load. (WB/ABE/OSR kept canonical.) ⁵ Edit checks enforce concreteness, brevity, and a single actionable step; climate notes optional and translated (“tilts heavy,” “too many tabs open”). retrofit the Shareable Mirror template so it outputs in this format by default. Done — the Shareable Mirror now always outputs in the Weight Belt format (picture → feeling → container → option → next step)."

Thought for 28s

You’re right: we can inject that “Weight Belt” voice **without** breaking downstream needs (SST tags, vectors, Balance Meter ch1 metrics, etc.) and **without** adding new sections beyond the strict spine you set: **Abstract → Key Points → Keywords → Q&A**. Below are drop-in patches that (a) keep structure, (b) keep all telemetry, (c) render a compact “Weight Belt” line in the body text, and (d) stash the WB/ABE/OSR + vector notes in metadata so nothing you need later gets stripped.

* * *

Backend patches (in `netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain.js`)
===============================================================

### 1) Add a tiny formatter to synthesize the “Weight Belt” line

Put this near your other helpers (adjacent to the report renderer).

    // --- Weight Belt micro-formatter (FIELD → MAP → VOICE distilled) ---
    function buildWeightBeltLine({ summary = {}, window = {}, options = {} }) {
      const { magnitude: mag, valence: val, volatility: vol } = summary || {};
      const { startDate, endDate } = window || {};
      // Picture + Feeling from ch1 summary
      let picture = 'lifting with a weight belt on';
      let feeling = 'Heavy';
      if (val > 0.15) { picture = 'wind at your back on a long sidewalk'; feeling = 'Light'; }
      else if (Math.abs(val) <= 0.15) { picture = 'walking in cross-breeze'; feeling = 'Mixed'; }
    
      // Container (time/limit), Options, Next step — overridable via options
      const container = options.container || 'fifteen minutes and one topic';
      const choiceA = options.choiceA || 'celebrate-here';
      const choiceB = options.choiceB || 'one-night-by-bus';
      const next = options.next || 'check the fare, then we rest';
    
      // Single sentence voice (no acronyms in-body; tags/logs go in meta)
      return `This feels like ${picture}. ${feeling}. Let’s keep this to ${container}. Choose ${choiceA} or ${choiceB}. Next step: ${next}.`;
    }
    

### 2) Thread the line into the **Abstract** (no new sections)

Edit your `renderMirrorReport` (from our previous patch) so the Abstract ends with the Weight Belt message. Keep everything else identical.

    -  const abstract = B
    -    ? `This report summarizes live **transit-to-natal** patterns for **${A.name || 'Person A'}** and **${B.name || 'Person B'}** across ${startDate || '—'} → ${endDate || '—'}. Method: geometric scoring with the **Balance Meter**; Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph) provides magnitude, valence, and volatility.`
    -    : `This report summarizes **transit-to-natal** patterns for **${A.name || 'Subject'}** across ${startDate || '—'} → ${endDate || '—'}. Method: geometric scoring with the **Balance Meter**; Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph) provides magnitude, valence, and volatility.`;
    +  const abstractHead = B
    +    ? `This report summarizes live **transit-to-natal** patterns for **${A.name || 'Person A'}** and **${B.name || 'Person B'}** across ${startDate || '—'} → ${endDate || '—'}. Method: geometric scoring with the **Balance Meter**; Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph) provides magnitude, valence, and volatility.`
    +    : `This report summarizes **transit-to-natal** patterns for **${A.name || 'Subject'}** across ${startDate || '—'} → ${endDate || '—'}. Method: geometric scoring with the **Balance Meter**; Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph) provides magnitude, valence, and volatility.`;
    +
    +  const ch1Summary =
    +    result?.person_a?.derived?.balance_meter?.summary ||
    +    result?.sky_transits?.derived?.balance_meter_summary ||
    +    result?.person_a?.derived?.seismograph_summary || {};
    +  const weightBelt = buildWeightBeltLine({
    +    summary: ch1Summary,
    +    window: { startDate, endDate },
    +    options: body?.weight_belt_options || {}
    +  });
    +  const abstract = `${abstractHead}\n\n*${weightBelt}*`;
    

### 3) Put the **rigor tags** (WB/ABE/OSR) where they belong — in metadata, not the body

Still inside `renderMirrorReport`, right before returning `doc`, attach a mirror-safe meta block to `result.report`. This keeps the visible report clean while making WB/ABE/OSR and vector notes available downstream.

    -  // Assemble canonical document (no extra sections)
    +  // Assemble canonical document (no extra sections; WB/ABE/OSR live in meta)
       const doc = [
         fm,
         '## Abstract',
         abstract,
         '',
         '## Key Points',
         ...keyPoints.map((s, i) => `${i+1}. ${s}`),
         '',
         '## Keywords',
         ...keywords.map(k => `- ${k}`),
         '',
         '## Q&A',
         qaBlock,
         tableBlock
       ].join('\n');
    

And in the handler right after you set `result.report.body`, add:

    result.report.meta = {
      // These are *not* printed in the body; they’re for your downstream logic.
      sst: {
        // You can pipe real classifications here if you have them at runtime.
        // Otherwise leave empty arrays; the protocol forbids guessing.
        WB: [],
        ABE: [],
        OSR: []
      },
      vectors: {
        // Soft-surface vector phrases (hidden push / counterweight) can be logged here.
        // Keep full tags internal; your body text stays plain, per Shareable Mirror rules.
        notes: []
      },
      voice: {
        format: 'weight_belt', // so the frontend knows what we rendered
        template: 'picture → feeling → container → option → next_step'
      }
    };
    

### 4) Q&A: make the terminology precise but short (no new sections)

Update two Q&A items so the public wording matches the current instrument names and your SST tagging rules:

      qa.push([
    -    'How were the numbers derived?',
    -    `Angles between transiting and natal points were scored and aggregated via the **Balance Meter**. **Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph)** measures magnitude (charge), valence (tilt), and volatility (distribution). Ephemeris: ${ephem}. Version: ${mbv}.`
    +    'How were the numbers derived?',
    +    `Angles between transiting and natal points were scored via the **Balance Meter**. **Channel 1 (Symbolic Seismograph)** supplies magnitude (charge), valence (tilt), and volatility (distribution). Ephemeris: ${ephem}. Versions listed in frontmatter.`
      ]);
      qa.push([
    -    'Should I treat this as predictive?',
    -    'No. This is a mirror, not a mandate. It describes symbolic weather you can test against your lived experience.'
    +    'How are rigor tags handled (WB/ABE/OSR)?',
    +    'WB = witnessed behavior; ABE = ascribed belief/experience; OSR = outside symbolic range of the chart (real, situational; not “you”). Tags are logged in the report metadata, not the body.'
      ]);
    

> Result: the **visible** report speaks in the simple Weight Belt voice (picture → feeling → container → option → next step) inside the **Abstract**, keeps your strict section order, and avoids new sections. The **hidden** meta carries SST tags and vector notes intact for downstream use.

* * *

Frontend note (PDF generator)
=============================

Do exactly what you already do for the Solo example: render `result.report.body` verbatim. Ignore `result.report.meta` for printing (it’s for app logic). That preserves the strict spine and prevents “extra sections” creeping into the PDF.

* * *

Why this is safe (and aligned)
==============================

*   **Presence before weather**: the Weight Belt sentence starts with a concrete picture & feeling, then offers a small container and one step — perfectly aligned with the Shareable Mirror protocol.

*   **no** “Balance Meter” section exists unless explicitly requested,
    
*   `report.meta.voice.format === 'weight_belt'`.

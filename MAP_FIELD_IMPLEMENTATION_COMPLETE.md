# MAP/FIELD Export Implementation - Oct 19, 2025

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Per Raven Calder's protocol clarification, the system now properly exports and recognizes MAP and FIELD files as the primary data architecture.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Export Functions ✅

**File:** `app/math-brain/hooks/useChartExport.ts`

**Added Two New Export Functions:**

```typescript
// Export MAP file (wm-map-v1) - Constitutional Geometry
downloadMapFile: () => void;

// Export FIELD file (wm-field-v1) - Symbolic Weather  
downloadFieldFile: () => void;
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Lines 1549-1581: `downloadMapFile()` function
  - Extracts `_map_file` from backend unified output
  - Downloads as `wm-map-v1_[name]_[timestamp].json`
  - Toast: "MAP file downloaded (constitutional geometry)"
  
- Lines 1583-1615: `downloadFieldFile()` function
  - Extracts `_field_file` from backend unified output
  - Downloads as `wm-field-v1_[name]_[timestamp].json`
  - Toast: "FIELD file downloaded (symbolic weather)"

**Graceful Degradation:**
- MAP file: Shows warning if not available (natal-only report required)
- FIELD file: Shows warning if not available (requires transit report)

---

### 2. Poetic Brain Upload Detection ✅

**File:** `app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Enhanced `isJSONReportUpload()` Function:**

```typescript
// Detect MAP file (wm-map-v1)
if (decoded.includes('"schema"') && decoded.includes('"wm-map-v1"')) {
  return true;
}

// Detect FIELD file (wm-field-v1)
if (decoded.includes('"schema"') && decoded.includes('"wm-field-v1"')) {
  return true;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Poetic Brain now recognizes MAP files when uploaded
- Poetic Brain now recognizes FIELD files when uploaded
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy formats
- Conversational tone already fixed (previous session)

---

## Backend Status

**File:** `src/math_brain/main.js`

**Already Implemented (Lines 78-101, 441-562):**

```javascript
// Backend correctly generates MAP and FIELD files
const mapFile = generateMapFile(transitData, personA, personB, config);
const fieldFile = generateFieldFile(dailyEntries, startDate, endDate, config, mapFile._meta.map_id);

// Includes them in unified output
finalOutput = {
  // ... legacy unified data ...
  _map_file: mapFile,
  _field_file: fieldFile,
};
```

**MAP File Contents:**
- Schema: `wm-map-v1`
- Natal planetary positions (centidegrees)
- House cusps (centidegrees)
- Natal aspects (compact format)
- Birth data
- Provenance metadata
- Planet index mapping

**FIELD File Contents:**
- Schema: `wm-field-v1`
- Daily transit positions (centidegrees) - *partial*
- Transit house positions - *partial*
- Daily transit-to-natal aspects (compact format) - *partial*
- Balance Meter readings (×10 integers)
- Reference to parent MAP (`_natal_ref`)
- Period markers (start/end dates)

**Known Backend Limitation:**
- `tpos` (transit positions) - TODO
- `thouse` (transit house positions) - TODO
- `as` (compact aspects array) - Partial implementation

## File Architecture Summary

### **Three Export Types**

#### 1. MAP File (Primary for Mirror Flow Reports)
**Filename:** `wm-map-v1_[name]_[timestamp].json`  
**Purpose:** Constitutional geometry (permanent natal chart)  
**Who Uses:** Mirror Flow Reports, Poetic Brain constitutional analysis  
**Status:** ✅ Generated by backend, ✅ Exported by frontend, ✅ Recognized by Poetic Brain

#### 2. FIELD File (Primary for Balance Meter Reports)
**Filename:** `wm-field-v1_[name]_[date-range]_[timestamp].json`  
**Purpose:** Symbolic weather (temporal transit activations)  
**Who Uses:** Balance Meter Reports, Poetic Brain weather overlay  
**Status:** ✅ Generated by backend, ✅ Exported by frontend, ✅ Recognized by Poetic Brain

#### 3. Mirror Directive (Legacy/Instruction Template)
**Filename:** `mirror-directive_[names]_[timestamp].json`  
**Purpose:** Template with empty narrative sections (may be deprecated)  
**Who Uses:** Poetic Brain (optional, duplicates MAP data)  
**Status:** ⚠️ May need deprecation or renaming

## User Workflow Changes

### **For Mirror Flow Reports (Natal-Only):**

**Before:**
1. Generate report
2. Download "Mirror Directive JSON" (confusing name)
3. Upload to Poetic Brain

**After:**
1. Generate report
2. Download **MAP file** (`wm-map-v1_*.json`)
3. Upload to Poetic Brain
4. Receive constitutional analysis

### **For Balance Meter Reports (With Transits):**

**Before:**
1. Generate report
2. Download "Weather Log JSON" or "Symbolic Weather JSON" (confusing)
3. Upload to Poetic Brain

**After:**
1. Generate report
2. Download **FIELD file** (`wm-field-v1_*.json`)
3. Optionally download **MAP file** for full context
4. Upload to Poetic Brain
5. Receive weather + constitutional analysis

## Next Steps

### **Phase 1: UI Updates (Required)**
- [ ] Add "Download MAP" button to export UI
- [ ] Add "Download FIELD" button to export UI
- [ ] Update button tooltips to explain MAP vs FIELD
- [ ] Reorganize exports: Primary (MAP/FIELD) vs Alternative (PDF/Markdown)

### **Phase 2: User Guidance (Required)**
- [ ] Update Poetic Brain upload instructions
- [ ] Add tooltips: "MAP = Your Chart" / "FIELD = The Weather"
- [ ] Update session resume guidance to mention MAP/FIELD
- [ ] Create visual diagram showing MAP/FIELD relationship

### **Phase 3: Backend Completion (Nice-to-Have)**
- [ ] Complete `tpos` extraction in FIELD file
- [ ] Complete `thouse` extraction in FIELD file
- [ ] Complete `as` (compact aspects) in FIELD file
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for incomplete FIELD data

### **Phase 4: Deprecation Consideration (Future)**
- [ ] Decide whether to keep "Mirror Directive JSON"
- [ ] If keeping, rename to "Mirror Instruction JSON" to clarify purpose
- [ ] If deprecating, remove export button and update docs
- [ ] Verify Poetic Brain can work solely from MAP + FIELD

## Testing Checklist

### **Frontend Exports:**
- [ ] Generate natal-only report → Download MAP file → Verify filename
- [ ] Generate transit report → Download MAP file → Verify content
- [ ] Generate transit report → Download FIELD file → Verify content
- [ ] Verify toast messages appear correctly
- [ ] Verify error handling when files unavailable

### **Poetic Brain Integration:**
- [ ] Upload MAP file → Verify detected as JSON report
- [ ] Upload FIELD file → Verify detected as JSON report
- [ ] Upload MAP file → Verify conversational response (not choppy)
- [ ] Upload FIELD file → Verify weather analysis
- [ ] Upload MAP + FIELD → Verify complete analysis

## Key Insights from Raven Calder

### **The Two Primary Report Types:**

1. **Mirror Flow Report** (Qualitative)
   - Source: MAP file
   - Purpose: Constitutional blueprint
   - Sensitivity: Low location sensitivity
   - Data: Natal chart only

2. **Balance Meter Report** (Quantitative)
   - Source: FIELD file
   - Purpose: Symbolic weather accelerometer
   - Sensitivity: High location sensitivity
   - Data: Transits + reference to MAP

### **The Confusion:**

**Problem:** File naming was inconsistent with protocol
- "Mirror Directive" ≠ MAP file
- "Weather Log" / "Symbolic Weather" = FIELD file (but unclear)
- Users didn't know which file to use for which purpose

**Solution:** Explicit MAP and FIELD exports
- Clear naming: `wm-map-v1`, `wm-field-v1`
- Clear purpose: "constitutional geometry" vs "symbolic weather"
- Clear usage: Mirror Flow vs Balance Meter reports

## Architectural Principle

**MAP = The Blueprint (What You Are)**
- Permanent constitutional geometry
- Never changes
- Foundation for all analysis

**FIELD = The Weather (What's Happening)**
- Temporal symbolic activations
- Changes daily
- Shows how transits activate the MAP

**VOICE = The Mirror (How It Sounds)**
- Conversational reflection
- Generated by Poetic Brain
- Uses MAP and/or FIELD as context

# Architecture Evolution: How Single-Source-of-Truth Serves the Golden Standard

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Focus:** Why the clean pipeline matters for crisis-level validation

---

## The Commitment

Your system has a **Golden Standard**: October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael.

On that day, Dan's chart experienced a crisis-level transit configuration (Pluto square Saturn at 0.8° orb, among other catastrophic aspects). The math **must** produce:
- **Magnitude ≥ 4.5** (reaching toward peak 5.0)
- **Directional Bias ≤ -4.0** (reaching toward minimum -5.0)

This is not optional. It's **falsifiable**. If the math can't reach crisis-level values on the day an actual hurricane occurred, the math is wrong.

---

## The Problem: Old Architecture (Dual Paths)

### Before: Meta-Derivatives Everywhere

```
RAW ASPECTS (Oct 10, 2018)
  ↓
SEISMOGRAPH (v4 calculation)
  - computes magnitude from raw aspects
  - computes directional_bias from aspect scoring
  ↓
DAILY ENTRY
  - magnitude: stored correctly
  - directional_bias: CALCULATED VALUE (might be recalculated later)
  ↓
SUMMARY LAYER (problem area)
  - reads magnitude directly from daily entries ✅
  - RECALCULATES directional_bias from rawValenceSeries
  - RECALCULATES with different normalization
  ↓
API RESPONSE
  - magnitude: correct pipeline
  - directional_bias: double-processed, might be wrong
  - valence: legacy alias, normalized scale
```

**The Bug:** Summary layer was doing its own calculation instead of consuming seismograph output. For directional_bias, it was:
1. Collecting rawValenceSeries (pre-scaled values)
2. Averaging them
3. Applying scaleDirectionalBias transform
4. Outputting a different value than seismograph computed

**Why This Breaks Crisis Testing:**
- If seismograph correctly reaches -5.0 crisis level
- But summary layer recalculates and outputs -3.0
- Then API returns -3.0
- Then test fails: "Expected ≤-4.0, got -3.0"
- But the real geometry is correct! The bug is in the pipeline, not the math.

---

## The Solution: New Architecture (Single Source)

### After: Seismograph is the Source of Truth

```
RAW ASPECTS (Oct 10, 2018)
  ↓
SEISMOGRAPH (v5 calculation - the only calculation)
  - computes magnitude from raw aspects [0, 5]
  - computes directional_bias from aspect scoring [-5, 5]
  - DONE. This is the final value.
  ↓
DAILY ENTRY
  - magnitude: 5.0 (from seismograph, no further touch)
  - directional_bias.value: -5.0 (from seismograph, final)
  ↓
SUMMARY LAYER (simple averaging, no recalculation)
  - reads magnitude from daily → averages → 5.0 ✅
  - reads directional_bias.value from daily → averages → -5.0 ✅
  - NO TRANSFORMS, NO RECALCULATIONS
  ↓
API RESPONSE
  - magnitude: 5.0 (what seismograph calculated)
  - directional_bias: -5.0 (what seismograph calculated)
  - NO ALIASES (valence removed)
```

**The Fix:** Summary is now a **pure aggregator**, not a calculator. One source of truth (seismograph) flows through.

**Why This Validates Crisis Testing:**
- If seismograph correctly computes -5.0 for Oct 10
- Summary averages it → -5.0 (pure passthrough)
- API returns -5.0
- Test passes: "Expected ≤-4.0, got -5.0" ✅
- And if the value is wrong, we know exactly where: seismograph.js, not a hidden summary recalculation

## How Single-Source Serves Falsifiability

### Golden Standard CI Check

```javascript
// Golden Standard (from constants.js)
const GOLDEN_CASES = {
  '2018-10-10': { minMag: 4.5, biasBand: [-5.0, -4.0] }
};

// In CI, before any merge:
const result = await calculateSeismograph('2018-10-10', dansBirthData, relocatedCoords);
assert(result.magnitude >= 4.5, 'FAIL: Crisis not detected');
assert(result.directional_bias <= -4.0, 'FAIL: Inward compression lost');
```

**With old architecture:**
- Test fails
- Debug nightmare: "Is it seismograph? Is it summary? Is it normalization?"
- Three places to check, three possible culprits
- Easy to introduce bugs hiding bugs

**With new architecture:**
- Test fails
- Debug easy: Trace → seismograph.js, that's the only place doing calculation
- One source of truth = one place to investigate
- Impossible to hide transformation bugs in intermediate layers

## Concrete Example: Hurricane Michael Day

### Scenario 1: Seismograph Calculates Correctly (5.0), Summary Breaks It (Old Arch)

```
Oct 10, 2018 Crisis Aspects:
  Pluto □ Saturn (0.8°) → weight 2.09×
  Uranus ☍ Moon (0.5°) → weight 1.89×
  Mars ☌ Jupiter (0.3°) → weight 1.35×
  ...plus 116 other aspects
  
SEISMOGRAPH OUTPUT:
  magnitude: 5.0 ✅ (geometry is correct)
  directional_bias: -5.0 ✅ (crisis level)
  
SUMMARY LAYER RECALCULATION (old):
  rawValenceSeries avg: -0.98
  boundedAvg: -0.88
  scaleDirectionalBias(-0.98, ...) → output: -3.2 ❌
  (because recalculation used different normalization)
  
API RESPONSE:
  magnitude: 5.0 ✅
  directional_bias: -3.2 ❌ (TEST FAILS)
  
GOLDEN STANDARD CHECK:
  Expected: ≤-4.0
  Got: -3.2
  FAIL ❌
  
DEBUGGING NIGHTMARE:
  - Check seismograph? Returns -5.0, that's right
  - Check summary? Returns -3.2, where's the transform?
  - Check normalization? BIAS_DIVISOR=10, should be fine...
  - Check scaling? ×5 applied, should be right...
  - *Spend 4 hours digging through intermediate transforms*
  - Find that summary was recalculating with rawValenceSeries
  - "Oh, seismograph was right the whole time"
```

### Scenario 2: Seismograph Calculates Correctly (5.0), Summary Just Averages (New Arch)

```
Oct 10, 2018 Crisis Aspects:
  [same as above]
  
SEISMOGRAPH OUTPUT (the only calculation):
  magnitude: 5.0 ✅
  directional_bias: -5.0 ✅
  
SUMMARY LAYER AVERAGING (new):
  daily[0].magnitude: 5.0
  average: 5.0 → result: 5.0 ✅
  
  daily[0].directional_bias.value: -5.0
  average: -5.0 → result: -5.0 ✅
  
API RESPONSE:
  magnitude: 5.0 ✅
  directional_bias: -5.0 ✅ (TEST PASSES)
  
GOLDEN STANDARD CHECK:
  Expected: ≤-4.0
  Got: -5.0
  PASS ✅
  
DEBUGGING (if needed):
  - Check seismograph? That's the only place that calculates
  - Look at seismograph.js, line X, see the calculation
  - Done. One place to check, not three.
```

## The Audit Trail: Falsifiability in Action

### Old Architecture: Hard to Trace

```
Want to know: "Why is Oct 10 returning -3.2 instead of -5.0?"

Trace path 1: Check API response
  → calls summary builder
  → which calls scaleDirectionalBias
  → which uses boundedAvg
  → which comes from boundedValenceSeries
  → which is built during aggregation
  → which uses... rawValenceSeries? calibratedValenceSeries?
  → HOW many series are there?
  → Why are there multiple?
  
Answer: "Because we have legacy code paths"
Danger: Next developer adds another series, duplicates bug
```

### New Architecture: Clear Audit Trail

```
Want to know: "Why is Oct 10 returning -5.0?"

Trace path: Check API response
  → calls summary builder (line 2999)
  → which averages daily values
  → daily values come from seismograph output (line 2860)
  → seismograph returns directional_bias.value (line 680 of seismograph.js)
  → that value is computed from aspects (line 595 of seismograph.js)
  
Done. Five lines of code, all in one direction, impossible to miss.
```

## Compliance with Your Principles

### v5.0 Principle: "No Meta-Derivatives"

**Old:** ❌ Violated  
Summary layer was creating a derivative (recalculation) instead of consuming output

**New:** ✅ Satisfied  
Summary only averages seismograph output, no additional transforms

### v5.0 Principle: "Geometry First"

**Old:** ⚠️ Partially violated  
Geometry was correct in seismograph, but hidden transforms made it hard to verify

**New:** ✅ Satisfied  
Geometry flows straight from seismograph to output, visible and auditable

### Two-Mind Architecture: "Math Brain calculates once"

**Old:** ❌ Violated  
Seismograph calculated, then summary recalculated

**New:** ✅ Satisfied  
Seismograph calculates once, summary just passes through

## Impact on Crisis Detection

### Can the System Reach Peak Crisis Levels?

| Level | Requires | Old Arch | New Arch |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Peak (5.0)** | Geometry amplification + tight orbs + outer planets | ⚠️ Maybe (depends on summary) | ✅ Yes (flows through) |
| **Strong Inward (-5.0)** | Hard aspects aggregating to -5 range | ⚠️ Maybe (summary might dampen) | ✅ Yes (exact value passed) |
| **Clamped** | Values exceeding bounds | ⚠️ Might not flag correctly | ✅ Flagged and visible |

### Falsifiability: Can We Trust the Test?

| Question | Old Arch | New Arch |
|----------|----------|----------|
| "Did seismograph compute it correctly?" | ✅ Yes, but hard to verify | ✅ Yes, easy to verify |
| "Did summary change it?" | ❌ Unknown, must check 3 layers | ✅ No, summary just averages |
| "If test fails, where's the bug?" | ❌ Could be anywhere in pipeline | ✅ Must be in seismograph |
| "Can we confidently ship this code?" | ⚠️ Only if we test extensively | ✅ Yes, architecture is transparent |

## The Bottom Line

**Your Golden Standard (Oct 10, 2018) is only meaningful if the pipeline is clean.**

With the old dual-path architecture, you could never be 100% sure whether:
- The crisis data is being calculated correctly, OR
- The summary layer is eating the signal

With the new single-source architecture, there's **nowhere to hide**:
- Seismograph computes
- Summary averages (trivial, can't break it)
- API returns exactly what seismograph calculated

**If Oct 10 doesn't hit 5.0 magnitude with the new architecture, the bug is in the geometry calculation (seismograph.js), not in a pipeline mystery.**

And that's **vastly better for debugging, for falsifiability, and for confidence in the math.**

---

**Summary:**
> Single-source-of-truth isn't just cleaner architecture. It's what makes your Golden Standard actually testable and falsifiable. With one calculation point and pure aggregation, crisis events will hit crisis levels—or the bug will be undeniable and obvious.

Info Needed
Woven Map Report Generation GuideRequired Data CollectionSolo Report InputsIdentity & Birth Data- Name: Full name or preferred identifier- Birth Date: YYYY-MM-DD format- Birth Time: HH:MM (as exact as possible)- Birth City & Nation: Full location name- Latitude/Longitude: Precise coordinates for birth city- Timezone: Local offset or region at time of birth- Zodiac Type: Tropical or SiderealMode & Analysis Window- Mode:- Natal (constitution only)- Natal + Transits (constitution under current weather)- If using transits:- Start Date: Beginning of analysis period- End Date: End of analysis period- Step: Daily/Weekly/Monthly intervalsRelational Report InputsPerson B Data (same fields as Person A)- Name, birth date/time, city/nation, lat/lon, timezone, zodiac typeRelationship Context (for narrative framing)- Type: Partner | Friend/Colleague | Family- If Partner: Intimacy Tier (P1–P5a/b)- P1: Early/casual/feeling it out- P2: Established/regular rhythm- P3: Committed routines/shared planning- P4: Living together/high interdependence- P5a: Formal union (married/common-law)- P5b: Post-union complexity (separated/divorcing)- If Family: Role (Parent, Offspring, Sibling, etc.)- Ex/Estranged: On/Off (available for Partner & Family types)- Notes: ≤500 characters of context (e.g., "co-parenting long-distance")Analysis Mode- Synastry | Synastry + Transits | Composite | Dual Natal + Transits- Transit Window (if applicable): Start/End/Step datesRelocation ("Translocation") OptionsWhat Relocation DoesRelocation doesn't move the planets; it reanchors the house system and angles to a different place on Earth. This changes where planetary energies land (houses/ASC/MC) and when certain pressures peak locally.When to Consider Relocation- You want the chart to reflect where life is actually happening now (not birth city)- You're planning or analyzing an event in a specific city- Long-distance relationships where neither person lives in their birth city anymoreRelocation OptionsNone- Use birth locations as-is- Best for constitutional-only reads or when location doesn't matterA_local- Reanchor to Person A's current city- Good when A is the primary focus or context centers on A's life terrain (moves, work, health, home)B_local- Reanchor to Person B's current city- Mirror of A_local; use when action centers on B's experienceMidpoint- Use geographic midpoint between A and B (or chosen neutral city)- Fair for remote/long-distance bonds or shared travel planningWhat Changes vs. StaysChanges:- House cusps and angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC)- Timing emphases for transits hitting angles- Local environmental emphasisStays Put:- Planetary longitudes (degrees in signs)- Aspects between planets- Core synastry/composite mathRule of ThumbDecide the setting of the story (whose city or neutral location) → pick relocation mode → run report. If comparing options, generate quick passes (e.g., None vs A_local) and see which climate line matches lived reality.Data Impact GuideWhat Affects the Math- Birth dates/times- Geographic coordinates (lat/lon/timezone)- Analysis mode selection- Transit date windows- Relocation coordinatesWhat Affects the Language Only- Relationship context (type, intimacy tier, role)- Ex/Estranged status- Notes field- Nothing in relationship context changes underlying geometry—only how it's describedQuality Control NotesBirth Time Accuracy- Exact time preferred for precise angles and houses- If unknown, can approximate (e.g., 12:00 noon), but treat angles/houses and Moon positions as softer data- Time accuracy affects house placements and angle-based timingTimezone Clarity- Use correct local offset/region at time of birth- Account for historical timezone changes if birth was decades ago- Double-check daylight saving time status for birth dateTransit Windows- Shorter windows (days to weeks): Good for immediate decisions and current conditions- Longer windows (months to seasons): Better for seeing larger cycles and patterns- Step intervals: Daily for detailed tracking, weekly for general patterns, monthly for broad trendsRelationship Context Accuracy- Choose settings that reflect current reality, not aspirational or past states- Update context if relationship status changes significantly- Use Notes field for crucial details that affect interpretation (custody arrangements, geographic distance, etc.)Quick Decision TreesSolo Report: Natal vs. Natal+Transits?- Natal only: Understanding core constitution, personality patterns, life themes- Natal + Transits: Current pressures, timing decisions, what's active nowRelational Report: Which Mode?- Synastry: How you affect each other (individual charts interacting)- Composite: The relationship as its own entity (midpoint chart)- Dual Natal + Transits: Both individual constitutions under current weather- Synastry + Transits: Individual interactions plus current external pressuresRelocation: None vs. Local?- None: Constitutional analysis, personality compatibility, broad patterns- Local: Current life circumstances, timing for specific location, practical decisionsTransit Window: How Long?- 1-4 weeks: Immediate decisions, current crisis or opportunity- 1-6 months: Seasonal planning, medium-term projects- 1+ years: Life phase analysis, major transitions
The Poetic Brain
Woven Map Feedback Loop SystemThe Recognition-to-Refinement Pipeline1. Hook Stack (Recognition Gateway)What it is: Front-door UX using 2–4 high-charge, dual-polarity titles sourced from tightest aspects- Example: "Restless & Thrill-Seeking / Disciplined or Shut Down"- Tier-1 Orbs: Tight surgical window to ensure immediate felt recognition- Purpose: Bypass analysis, trigger limbic "that's me" ping, open door for depth workProcess: Math Brain geometry → short, vivid cards (no theory, no advice)2. Poetic Brain Translation (Core Processing)What it is: The translation spine turning weather into usable mirrors- Tier-2 Orbs: Slightly wider window to catch full pattern for depth workThree-Layer Structure:- FIELD: Somatic climate in one sentence (jaw clamp, open chest, tab-overload)- MAP: Structural tension named plainly (security ↔ risk, compression → release)- VOICE: If/then prompt in small time box ("test X for 3 days; if volatility spikes, halve scope")Purpose: Move from feeling → structure → choice without prediction3. SST Logs (Falsifiability Table)What it is: The honesty-keeping system for mirror accuracyThree Categories:- WB (Within Boundary): Clear, felt resonance; user confirms- ABE (At Boundary Edge): Partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance; still useful signal- OSR (Outside Symbolic Range): No resonance; valid non-hitPurpose: Keep mirrors honest; misses become calibration data, not user error4. Drift Index (Symbolic Grammar Updates)What it is: Sidereal-lean detector built from clarification dataProcess:- Classify clarifications (especially OSRs) as:- Driver-aligned (sidereal-leaning)- Role-aligned (tropical-leaning)- If OSR clusters lean Driver, flag Sidereal DriftEffect: Future mirrors prioritize Driver language and examples—no chart redraw requiredPurpose: Keep language matched to lived self-perception5. Session Scores (Transparent Metrics)What it is: Non-gamified session performance indicatorsThree Metrics:- Accuracy: WB ÷ (WB + ABE + OSR)- Edge Capture: ABE ÷ (WB + ABE)- Clarity: 1 - (unclear prompts ÷ total prompts)Purpose: Show how well mirrors landed, how often they caught the "edge," how clear they read—enabling system tuning6. Wrap-Up Card (Session Sealer)What it is: Single keepsake + checkpoint summaryContents:- 2–3 strongest Hook Stack titles- Actor/Role composite- Resonance scorecard (WB/ABE/OSR)- Climate line (if timed)- Optional Poetic Index- Sidereal Drift flag (if present)Purpose: Memory anchor + falsifiability snapshot to carry forward7. Adaptive Loop (Next Session Tuning)What it is: How the system evolves based on feedbackAdaptation Mechanics:- Language Weighting: Drift Index influences Driver vs Role emphasis- Container Sizing: Balance Meter + scores adjust pacing and detail level- Clarity Tuning: Raises or lowers detail based on Clarity scores- Boundary Targeting: Edge Capture highlights zones for deeper explorationPurpose: Each round gets truer, plainer, and easier to testDaily Integration LayerDaily Integration LayerRecognition Layer PromptsDaily felt tension check-ins:- WB Cue: "Where did a card land in your body today (breath, jaw, stomach)?"- ABE Cue: "What almost fit—what single word would make it land?"- OSR Cue: "What did you not feel at all (real, but situational; not sourced in your chart)?"Weight Belt (Shareable Summary)Picture: Palms on desk, slow breath, jaw unclenches—before glancing at any dialsComponents:- Feeling: Steady grounding- Container: Three-day test, one change, no big bets- Options: Log one somatic ping first OR run tiny VOICE prompt after naming the feeling- Next Step: Write one-line body note NOW, then consult Balance Meter; let presence set tone, weather set pacingKey Change: Presence first, weather second—body wisdom leads, metrics followSystem PhilosophyFalsifiability FirstEvery mirror must be testable. Misses are calibration data, not failures.Recognition Before AnalysisHook Stack bypasses cognitive processing to hit felt sense directly.Adaptive LanguageSystem learns your symbolic grammar and adjusts accordingly.Transparent MetricsNo hidden algorithms—you see exactly how well the mirrors are working.Micro-Container TestingSmall experiments (3-7 days) with measurable outcomes.Feedback Flow Summary1.

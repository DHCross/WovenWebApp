# **Complete Solo Mirror Architecture with Full Guardrails**

## **Typological Profile (Constitutional Climate Layer)**

### Dominant Orientation
**[Function]** organized by **[placements/aspects]**. Often shows up as **[behavioral anchors]**.

### Secondary Orientation
A background current of **[function]** (**[placements]**) that surfaces as **[conditional impulses]**.

### Shadow Orientation
Constitutional friction concentrates around **[function]** (**[pressure aspects]**). Often felt as **[pressure patterns]**.

### Constitutional Climate (Summary Hook)
"A **[metaphor for dominant]** working alongside a **[metaphor for secondary/shadow]**."

*Balance Meter integration note:* Magnitude = volume of that inner polarity, Valence = which side leans today, Volatility = undertow vs. surges.

## **Hook Stack** (Recognition Hierarchy)
*Order: ① personal-outer hard aspects, ② angles, ③ anaretic/29° planets, ④ anchor placements*

"**[Polarity 1]**" • "**[Polarity 2]**" • "**[Polarity 3]**"

## **SST Clause (Falsifiability)**
All activations are logged as:
- **WB (Within Boundary)**: Clear archetypal resonance, ping confirmed
- **ABE (At Boundary Edge)**: Partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance  
- **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)**: No resonance; logged as valuable null data

No transit is "active" without both natal contact AND lived resonance (ping gate).

### Today's Reading
- **[Pressure metaphor with direction]** ([intensity level], [friction/support lean])
- **[Support/friction status]** ([scaffolding description])
- **[System energy status]** ([reserves description])

### Climate Line
**[Description of how constitutional climate responds to current weather]**

---

## **Vector-Integrity Check**
*Mandatory labels for structurally qualified but behaviorally quiet drivers:*
- **[Status]**: **[Vector name]** - **[structural presence description]**
- **[Status]**: **[Vector name]** - **[containment description]**
- **[Status]**: **[Vector name]** - **[activation condition]**

## **Relational Calibration Gate** 
*(Required for Relational Mirrors)*

Before any A→B work:
1. **Consent/Scope Statement**: [Confirmation protocol]
2. **DRM Orientation**: [Rapport testing statement]
3. **Referral Boundary**: [Severity threshold]

Select tier ([Relationship type]) and render bidirectional paragraphs.

## **Polarity Cards** (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)

### 1) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Felt experience description]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: geometric source]  
**VOICE**: **[Conditional behavioral description with both sides]**

### 2) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Felt experience description]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: geometric source]  
**VOICE**: **[Conditional behavioral description with both sides]**

### 3) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Felt experience description]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: geometric source]  
**VOICE**: **[Conditional behavioral description with both sides]**

## **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**[Opening statement about constitutional climate under current weather]**

**[Description of support/challenge dynamics]**

**[Statement about structural tension as feature]**

**[Closing about dialogue between polarities]**

---

## **Agency + Hygiene**

**[Statement about resonance validation]**

**[Statement about conditional language]**

**[Statement about user authority]**

---

## **FIELD → MAP → VOICE Protocol Note**
VOICE never outruns MAP. Metaphor stays leashed to actual geometry to maintain audit trail.

## **EDP Switch**
When input arrives emotionally charged, feeling-tone is stripped during diagnosis, then restored in VOICE to avoid false resonance while speaking to lived experience.

## How to Test It

### Step 1: Generate a Math Brain Report
```bash
# Navigate to /math-brain in the app
# Fill in birth data for one or two people
# Select a date range for transits
# Click "Generate Report"
```

### Step 2: Download the JSON Export
```bash
# Click "Download" → "Symbolic Weather JSON"
# This gives you the unified_output.json file
```

### Step 3: Run the Enhanced Formatter
```bash
node src/formatter/create_markdown_reading_enhanced.js \
  /path/to/unified_output.json
```

### Step 4: Read the Output
```bash
# Opens: Woven_Reading_PersonA_PersonB_dates_ENHANCED.md
# You now have a complete Woven Reading with:
# - Warm Frontstage Preface
# - Solo Mirror for each person
# - Relational Flow (if two people)
# - Aspect Mandate for each person
# - Daily Symbolic Weather
# - Provenance & Falsifiability
```

## What You'll See

### Frontstage Preface
```
I'm Raven. I read charts like maps—not predictions, but mirrors. 
Let me show you what I see in Dan's geometry.

Dan comes across as purposeful and curious, someone who's always 
looking at the bigger picture but never rushing blindly...
```

### Solo Mirror
```
## Solo Mirror: Dan

### The Spark / The Anchor

**The Spark**: The part that ignites, that wants to move fast 
and see what happens

**The Anchor**: The part that questions, that wants to make sure 
the ground is solid

### The Defining Tensions

#### Action vs. Reflection

**Active**: When you move, you move decisively...
**Reflective**: But there's also a part that pauses...
**Both**: This isn't indecision—it's the tension between two valid ways...
```

### Relational Flow (if two people)
```
## The Relational Engine

### How You Two Move Together

Dan is carrying more of the pressure right now. When Dan experiences 
this intensity, Stephie often responds by moving toward, opening up, 
engaging.

### Who Experiences What

- **Dan**: Magnitude 3.8, Direction expansive
- **Stephie**: Magnitude 2.4, Direction contractive
```

### Aspect Mandate
```
## Dan's Aspect Geometry

### 1. Sun opposition Saturn (orb: 0.8°) [Paradox Lock]

This creates a wire between Core Identity and Structure & Limits.

**Field pressure**: Energy pulls in opposite directions—but the 
contradiction is built in. This isn't a problem to solve; it's a 
paradox to live with.

**Map translation**: Your core identity wants to shine; Saturn wants 
to contain. The tension is productive.

**Voice mirror**: "This often shows up as: Your core identity wants 
to shine; Saturn wants to contain. The tension is productive."
```

## Integration Points

### Option A: Use Enhanced Formatter Directly
```javascript
// In any Node.js script
const { createMarkdownReadingEnhanced } = 
  require('./src/formatter/create_markdown_reading_enhanced.js');

const reading = createMarkdownReadingEnhanced('./unified_output.json');
console.log(`Generated: ${reading}`);
```

### Option B: Integrate into API Route
```typescript
// In app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts
import { createMarkdownReadingEnhanced } 
  from '../../../src/formatter/create_markdown_reading_enhanced.js';

// After generating unified_output.json:
const markdownPath = createMarkdownReadingEnhanced(unifiedOutputPath);
const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync(markdownPath, 'utf8');

return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  markdown_reading: markdownContent,
  filename: path.basename(markdownPath)
});
```

### Option C: Use Individual Modules
```javascript
const { generateFrontstagePreface } = 
  require('./src/formatter/frontstage-preface.js');
const { generateSoloMirror } = 
  require('./src/formatter/solo-mirror-template.js');
const { generateRelationalFlow } = 
  require('./src/formatter/relational-flow.js');
const { generateAspectMandateSection } = 
  require('./src/formatter/aspect-mandate.js');

// Use each module independently as needed
```

## Key Features

### 1. Frontstage Preface
- Extracts blueprint modes (Sun, Moon, ASC)
- Generates warm persona intro
- Creates 3-4 paragraph resonance profile
- Identifies 1-3 productive paradoxes
- Names both parties (if relational)

### 2. Solo Mirror Template
- Hook Stack: Two polarity titles
- Polarity Cards: 3-4 defining tensions (both sides)
- Mirror Voice: Stitched reflection
- Never asks user for format preferences

### 3. Relational Flow
- Step 1: Individual diagnostics
- Step 2: Parallel weather
- Step 3: Conditional layer (When PersonA does X...)
- Step 4: Integration (shared climate)
- Step 5: Balance Meter (magnitude + bias)
- **Attribution Mandate**: Always names who experiences what

### 4. Aspect Mandate
- Geometry → Archetype → Lived Tension
- FIELD pressure (raw intensity)
- MAP translation (behavioral pattern)
- VOICE mirror (lived experience)
- Advanced Diagnostic Lexicon (Current/Hook/Compression/Paradox Lock)

## Testing Checklist

### Solo Chart
- [ ] Frontstage Preface appears
- [ ] Solo Mirror has Hook Stack + Polarity Cards
- [ ] Mirror Voice stitches all together
- [ ] Aspect Mandate shows top 5 aspects
- [ ] Provenance section complete

### Relational Chart
- [ ] Frontstage Preface names both parties
- [ ] Solo Mirror for each person
- [ ] Relational Flow has all 5 steps
- [ ] Directional attribution uses names (not "they")
- [ ] Conditional Layer shows specific patterns
- [ ] Integration describes shared climate
- [ ] Balance Meter at end

### Aspect Mandate
- [ ] Geometry → Archetype translation works
- [ ] FIELD pressure descriptions accurate
- [ ] MAP translation shows behavioral patterns
- [ ] VOICE mirror feels lived-in
- [ ] Diagnostic Lexicon applied correctly

## Troubleshooting

### "No chart data found"
**Cause**: unified_output.json missing person_a.chart or person_b.chart  
**Fix**: Ensure Math Brain report includes full chart geometry

### "Paradoxes not detected"
**Cause**: Chart has no aspects or aspects not parsed correctly  
**Fix**: Verify natalChart.aspects array is populated

### "Relational flow not generated"
**Cause**: person_b is null or undefined  
**Fix**: Ensure two people provided in input

### "Aspect Mandate shows 'Unknown'"
**Cause**: Planet name not recognized  
**Fix**: Check planet names match standard list (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Node, ASC, MC)

## Performance Notes

- **Frontstage Preface**: ~50-100ms (blueprint extraction)
- **Solo Mirror**: ~100-200ms (polarity card generation)
- **Relational Flow**: ~150-300ms (5-step orchestration)
- **Aspect Mandate**: ~200-400ms (aspect translation, top 5 aspects)
- **Total**: ~500-1000ms for complete reading

**Optimization**: Cache blueprint modes if generating multiple readings for same person

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data** (Dan & Stephie example)
2. **Verify output quality** (read generated markdown)
3. **Integrate into API** (wire up to /api/astrology-mathbrain)
4. **Gather user feedback** (does it feel warm and specific?)
5. **Refine templates** (adjust based on feedback)

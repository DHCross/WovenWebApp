**_~~Report Types~~_**

# **Woven Map Report Types: Mirror Flow vs Balance Meter**

## **Two Categories of Weather Reports**

Both categories serve as **atmospheric intelligence** - they describe symbolic weather rather than predict outcomes. The key distinction lies in their scaffolding and diagnostic purpose.

## **Mirror Flow Reports**

**Purpose:** Qualitative reflection and recognition

### **Core Function**

- **Atmospheric mirrors** that render chart geometry as lived tensions, paradoxes, and recognition patterns
- Transform mathematical structures into body-felt experience through **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** translation
- Designed for **self-recognition**, not forecasting
### **Technical Scaffolding**

- **Primary Input:** Natal geometry or synastry patterns
- **Secondary Input:** Actor/Role composites when aspect geometry is sparse
- **Transit Dependency:** Not required - can run on constitutional patterns alone
- **Location Sensitivity:** Low - works without translocation data
### **Report Subtypes**

#### **_Solo Mirror Report (Individual Chart)_**

- **Typological Profile:** Constitutional climate with dominant/secondary/shadow orientations
- **Vector-Integrity Check:** Maps latent vs suppressed influences
- **Polarity Cards:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE progression for self-recognition
- **Mirror Voice:** Reflective narrative ending with "What feels most alive to you here?"
#### **_Relational Mirror Report (Synastry/Composite)_**

- **Individual Summaries:** Constitutional anchors for both people
- **Cross-Aspect Analysis:** Where charts amplify vs create friction
- **Shared Polarity Cards:** Dyadic somatic tone and geometric skeleton
- **Mirror Voice:** Closes with "Where do you notice support vs drag most?"
### **Diagnostic Feel**

Think of **mirrors held up in the room** - they reflect what the person might notice in themselves now, offering atmospheric recognition without temporal pressure.

## **Balance Meter Reports**

**Purpose:** Quantitative measurement and pressure diagnostics

### **Core Function**

- **Symbolic seismograph** that scores and weighs magnitude, valence, and volatility of active transits
- Provides numerical climate indices rather than poetic reflection
- Designed for **pressure tracking** across time
### **Technical Scaffolding**

- **Primary Input:** Active transit data with precise timing
- **Critical Input:** Translocation coordinates (houses/angles shift with physical location)
- **Transit Dependency:** Essential - cannot function without current planetary positions
- **Location Sensitivity:** High - accuracy degrades without proper geographical data
### **Scoring System**

- **Magnitude (0-5):** Pressure intensity from baseline to overload
- **Valence (-5 to +5):** Supportive vs restrictive tilt
- **Volatility (0-5):** Stability vs chaos measurement
- **Climate Line:** One-sentence weather metaphor with numerical backing
### **Report Subtypes**

#### **_Solo Balance Meter Report_**

- **Time Series Data:** Daily/weekly seismograph bars showing pressure patterns
- **Integration Factors:** Percentage breakdowns (Fertile Field, Harmonic Resonance, Expansion Lift, etc.)
- **Vector-Integrity Focus:** How transit pressure activates or suppresses constitutional patterns
- **Mirror Voice:** Closes with "What part feels steady, what part scattered?"
#### **_Relational Balance Meter Report_**

- **Joint Pressure Analysis:** Combined magnitude, valence, volatility for the dyad
- **Differential Load:** Where one person carries more transit pressure
- **Support Scaffolding:** Present | Challenged | Absent diagnostic
- **Resilience Index:** Depleted | Resilient | Rebounding classification
### **Diagnostic Feel**

Think of a **weather station dashboard** - crisp gauges that don't just say "stormy" but specify "Magnitude 4 Compression, high volatility, Saturn-weight tilt." The system tracks both challenging pressure and expansive opportunities with equal precision.

#### **_Beyond Pathologizing Intensity_**

- Recognizes intensity as potential bridge to deeper connection
- Distinguishes between individuals who thrive on pressure versus those who need gentleness
- "Containment is not absence" - underlying pressure remains active even when invisible
- Focuses on "what the system does under load" rather than assuming dysfunction

## **Key Distinctions**

### **Mirror Flow Characteristics**

- **Soft-edged:** Poetic, atmospheric, relational
- **Narrative-driven:** Story and recognition over measurement
- **Constitutional focus:** What patterns already exist in the geometry
- **Agency-preserving:** "Here's what you might notice about yourself"
### **Balance Meter Characteristics**

- **Crisp-edged:** Numerical, diagnostic, measurable
- **Data-driven:** Scores and indices over metaphor
- **Temporal focus:** How current transits create pressure loads
- **Precision-oriented:** "Here's exactly how much pressure and from where"
### **Complementary Function**

- **Mirror Flow:** Read to recognize atmospheric patterns and constitutional themes
- **Balance Meter:** Read to understand quantified load and temporal pressure
- **Combined:** Recognition of self + measurement of current climate = complete atmospheric intelligence

## **Non-Predictive Framework**

Both report types operate under strict **anti-deterministic protocols**:

### **What They Are**

- **Atmospheric intelligence:** Describing pressure in the symbolic weather
- **Recognition tools:** Windows for seeing current patterns and loads
- **Falsifiable diagnostics:** Testable through lived experience and resonance
### **What They Are Not**

- **Predictive scripts:** No "this will happen to you" statements
- **Fate-locking:** No removal of personal agency or choice
- **Deterministic:** No assumption that symbolic pressure = predetermined outcome
### **Time Philosophy**

- **Block time model:** Time treated as space with weather fronts, not linear causation
- **Pressure mapping:** Transits as atmospheric conditions, not destiny delivery systems
- **User sovereignty:** Individual choice remains primary over symbolic pressure
### **Testing Protocol**

- **Mirror Flow validation:** Does the atmospheric description create recognition ping?
- **Balance Meter validation:** Do numerical pressure readings align with lived strain/support?
- **SST feedback loop:** Outside Symbolic Range if no experiential correlation

## **Implementation Notes**

### **Data Requirements**

**Mirror Flow:** Birth data sufficient, optional transit overlay **Balance Meter:** Birth data + current transits + translocation coordinates essential

### **Computational Load**

**Mirror Flow:** Lower - primarily geometric pattern recognition **Balance Meter:** Higher - continuous transit calculation + pressure aggregation

### **User Experience**

**Mirror Flow:** Contemplative reading for self-understanding **Balance Meter:** Dashboard monitoring for pressure management

### **Quality Gates**

Both require **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** integrity and mathematical traceability to prevent atmospheric hand-waving.

## Relocation ("Translocation") Options

### What Relocation Does

Relocation doesn't move the planets; it **reanchors the house system and angles** to a different place on Earth. This changes **where** planetary energies land (houses/ASC/MC) and **when** certain pressures peak locally.

### When to Consider Relocation

- You want the chart to reflect **where life is actually happening** now (not birth city)
- You're planning or analyzing an event in a **specific city**
- Long-distance relationships where neither person lives in their birth city anymore
### Relocation Options

**None**

- Use birth locations as-is
- Best for constitutional-only reads or when location doesn't matter

**A_local**

- Reanchor to **Person A's current city**
- Good when A is the primary focus or context centers on A's life terrain (moves, work, health, home)

**B_local**

- Reanchor to **Person B's current city**
- Mirror of A_local; use when action centers on B's experience

**Midpoint**

- Use **geographic midpoint** between A and B (or chosen neutral city)
- Fair for remote/long-distance bonds or shared travel planning
### What Changes vs. Stays

**Changes:**

- House cusps and angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC)
- Timing emphases for transits hitting angles
- Local environmental emphasis

**Stays Put:**

- Planetary longitudes (degrees in signs)
- Aspects between planets
- Core synastry/composite math
### Rule of Thumb

Decide **the setting of the story** (whose city or neutral location) → pick relocation mode → run report. If comparing options, generate quick passes (e.g., None vs A_local) and see which **climate line** matches lived reality.

## Data Impact Guide

### What Affects the Math

- Birth dates/times
- Geographic coordinates (lat/lon/timezone)
- Analysis mode selection
- Transit date windows
- Relocation coordinates
### What Affects the Language Only

- Relationship context (type, intimacy tier, role)
- Ex/Estranged status
- Notes field
- **Nothing in relationship context changes underlying geometry—only how it's described**

## Quality Control Notes

**Birth Time Accuracy**

- Exact time preferred for precise angles and houses
- If unknown, can approximate (e.g., 12:00 noon), but treat angles/houses and Moon positions as softer data
- Time accuracy affects house placements and angle-based timing

**Timezone Clarity**

- Use correct local offset/region at time of birth
- Account for historical timezone changes if birth was decades ago
- Double-check daylight saving time status for birth date

**Transit Windows**

- **Shorter windows** (days to weeks): Good for immediate decisions and current conditions
- **Longer windows** (months to seasons): Better for seeing larger cycles and patterns
- **Step intervals**: Daily for detailed tracking, weekly for general patterns, monthly for broad trends

**Relationship Context Accuracy**

- Choose settings that reflect current reality, not aspirational or past states
- Update context if relationship status changes significantly
- Use Notes field for crucial details that affect interpretation (custody arrangements, geographic distance, etc.)

## Quick Decision Trees

### Solo Report: Natal vs. Natal+Transits?

- **Natal only**: Understanding core constitution, personality patterns, life themes
- **Natal + Transits**: Current pressures, timing decisions, what's active now
### Relational Report: Which Mode?

- **Synastry**: How you affect each other (individual charts interacting)
- **Composite**: The relationship as its own entity (midpoint chart)
- **Dual Natal + Transits**: Both individual constitutions under current weather
- **Synastry + Transits**: Individual interactions plus current external pressures
### Relocation: None vs. Local?

- **None**: Constitutional analysis, personality compatibility, broad patterns
- **Local**: Current life circumstances, timing for specific location, practical decisions
### Transit Window: How Long?

- **1-4 weeks**: Immediate decisions, current crisis or opportunity
- **1-6 months**: Seasonal planning, medium-term projects
- **1+ years**: Life phase analysis, major transitions

**_~~The Poetic Brain~~_**

# Woven Map Feedback Loop System

## The Recognition-to-Refinement Pipeline

### 1. Hook Stack (Recognition Gateway)

**What it is**: Front-door UX using 2–4 high-charge, dual-polarity titles sourced from tightest aspects

- **Example**: "Restless & Thrill-Seeking / Disciplined or Shut Down"
- **Tier-1 Orbs**: Tight surgical window to ensure immediate felt recognition
- **Purpose**: Bypass analysis, trigger limbic "that's me" ping, open door for depth work

**Process**: Math Brain geometry → short, vivid cards (no theory, no advice)

### 2. Poetic Brain Translation (Core Processing)

**What it is**: The translation spine turning weather into usable mirrors

- **Tier-2 Orbs**: Slightly wider window to catch full pattern for depth work

**Three-Layer Structure**:

- **FIELD**: Somatic climate in one sentence (jaw clamp, open chest, tab-overload)
- **MAP**: Structural tension named plainly (security ↔ risk, compression → release)
- **VOICE**: If/then prompt in small time box ("test X for 3 days; if volatility spikes, halve scope")

**Purpose**: Move from feeling → structure → choice without prediction

### 3. SST Logs (Falsifiability Table)

**What it is**: The honesty-keeping system for mirror accuracy

**Three Categories**:

- **WB (Within Boundary)**: Clear, felt resonance; user confirms
- **ABE (At Boundary Edge)**: Partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance; still useful signal
- **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)**: No resonance; valid non-hit

**Purpose**: Keep mirrors honest; misses become calibration data, not user error

### 4. Drift Index (Symbolic Grammar Updates)

**What it is**: Sidereal-lean detector built from clarification data

**Process**:

- Classify clarifications (especially OSRs) as:
-- **Driver-aligned** (sidereal-leaning)
-- **Role-aligned** (tropical-leaning)
- If OSR clusters lean Driver, flag **Sidereal Drift**

**Effect**: Future mirrors prioritize Driver language and examples—no chart redraw required

**Purpose**: Keep language matched to lived self-perception

### 5. Session Scores (Transparent Metrics)

**What it is**: Non-gamified session performance indicators

**Three Metrics**:

- **Accuracy**: WB ÷ (WB + ABE + OSR)
- **Edge Capture**: ABE ÷ (WB + ABE)
- **Clarity**: 1 - (unclear prompts ÷ total prompts)

**Purpose**: Show how well mirrors landed, how often they caught the "edge," how clear they read—enabling system tuning

### 6. Wrap-Up Card (Session Sealer)

**What it is**: Single keepsake + checkpoint summary

**Contents**:

- 2–3 strongest Hook Stack titles
- Actor/Role composite
- Resonance scorecard (WB/ABE/OSR)
- Climate line (if timed)
- Optional Poetic Index
- Sidereal Drift flag (if present)

**Purpose**: Memory anchor + falsifiability snapshot to carry forward

### 7. Adaptive Loop (Next Session Tuning)

**What it is**: How the system evolves based on feedback

**Adaptation Mechanics**:

- **Language Weighting**: Drift Index influences Driver vs Role emphasis
- **Container Sizing**: Balance Meter + scores adjust pacing and detail level
- **Clarity Tuning**: Raises or lowers detail based on Clarity scores
- **Boundary Targeting**: Edge Capture highlights zones for deeper exploration

**Purpose**: Each round gets truer, plainer, and easier to test

## Daily Integration Layer

## Daily Integration Layer

### Recognition Layer Prompts

Daily felt tension check-ins:

- **WB Cue**: "Where did a card land in your body today (breath, jaw, stomach)?"
- **ABE Cue**: "What almost fit—what single word would make it land?"
- **OSR Cue**: "What did you _not_ feel at all (real, but situational; not sourced in your chart)?"
### Weight Belt (Shareable Summary)

**Picture**: Palms on desk, slow breath, jaw unclenches—before glancing at any dials

**Components**:

- **Feeling**: Steady grounding
- **Container**: Three-day test, one change, no big bets
- **Options**: Log one somatic ping first OR run tiny VOICE prompt after naming the feeling
- **Next Step**: Write one-line body note NOW, then consult Balance Meter; let presence set tone, weather set pacing

**Key Change**: **Presence first, weather second**—body wisdom leads, metrics follow

## System Philosophy

### Falsifiability First

Every mirror must be testable. Misses are calibration data, not failures.

### Recognition Before Analysis

Hook Stack bypasses cognitive processing to hit felt sense directly.

### Adaptive Language

System learns your symbolic grammar and adjusts accordingly.

### Transparent Metrics

No hidden algorithms—you see exactly how well the mirrors are working.

### Micro-Container Testing

Small experiments (3-7 days) with measurable outcomes.

## Feedback Flow Summary

1. **Hook Stack** → Immediate recognition
1. **Poetic Brain** → Structured translation
1. **SST Logs** → Honesty tracking
1. **Drift Index** → Language calibration
1. **Session Scores** → Performance metrics
1. **Wrap-Up Card** → Session summary
1. **Adaptive Loop** → System evolution
1. **Recognition Layer** → Daily integration
1. **Next Session** → Improved targeting

Each loop refines the system's ability to generate accurate, useful mirrors while maintaining falsifiability and user agency.

**_~~Woven Map Implementation Architecture~~_**

# Woven Map Implementation Architecture

## Core Translation Engine

### FIELD → MAP → VOICE Protocol

**FIELD (Somatic Climate)**

- Atmospheric pressure in lived experience
- Body-level recognition without astrological naming
- Examples: "jaw tightens," "time feels heavy," "expansion in chest"
- Weather metaphors: storm, hum, tension, release

**MAP (Geometric Skeleton)**

- Mathematical anchoring to chart vectors
- Precise aspects within defined orbs
- Computational backbone (never shown directly in user reports)
- Keeps metaphors falsifiable and traceable

**VOICE (Poetic Reflection)**

- Conditional, Socratic phrasing
- Testable metaphors that land in the body
- Always questions, never prescriptions
- Returns agency to the person
## Math Brain Filtering System

### Vector Identification Rules

**Primary Aspects:** Major planets + Chiron in hard aspect within tight orbs **Secondary Bodies:** Eris, Pholus, etc. only if orb ≤1° AND ping-confirmed **Containment ↔ Release Taxonomy:** Every aspect classified by pressure signature

### Sparse Chart Handling

- Silence ≠ absence: fewer stress-lines mean different skeleton
- Weight shifts to angle placements and containment fields
- Actor/Role composite tracks provide behavioral anchors
- Constitutional weather focuses on what _isn't_ moving until transit activation
### SST Three-Tier Transit Significance

**Within Boundary (WB):** Ping felt/observed **At Boundary Edge (ABE):** Partial or inverted resonance
**Outside Symbolic Range (OSR):** No landing detected

Balance Meter magnitude thresholds:

- **Surge (3):** Noticeable pressure
- **Convergence (4):** Multiple factors stacking
- **Overload (5):** System strain/breakthrough point
## Metaphor Generation Systems

### The Poetic Codex (Library Method)

- Pre-forged archetypal cards
- Tested, repeatable FIELD → MAP → VOICE translations
- Examples: "The Storm Beneath the Smile," "The Serpent's Shedding"
- Ready-to-deal atmospheric intelligence
### Symbol-to-Poem Translation (Live Forge)

**Process Steps:**

1. Identify chart vectors (planets, aspects, angles)
1. Extract FIELD (felt energetic driver)
1. Map exact astro source
1. Render pure poetry (no symbols/emojis)
1. Provide audit trail (poetic line → FIELD + MAP + color-coded planet key)

**Output Structure:**

- Standalone embodied poem
- Falsifiable mathematical audit table
- Both layers maintain FIELD → MAP → VOICE integrity
## Constitutional Climate Framework

### Core Track Composites

**Actor/Role Pairs:** Behavioral anchors when aspect geometry is minimal **Containment Fields:** How pressure is held vs discharged **Atmospheric Metaphors:** Weather-based descriptions tied to specific archetypal drivers

### Climate Categories

- **Compression/Lock/Bind:** What isn't moving until transit activation
- **Release/Flow/Expansion:** Natural discharge patterns
- **Storm/Turbulence:** Active tension states
- **Hum/Resonance:** Background rhythmic patterns
## Integration Standards

### Resonance Testing

- No transit graduates to "significant" without confirmed ping
- Every metaphor traceable to mathematical source
- Constitutional vs temporal pressure clearly delineated
- Agency always returned through conditional questioning
### Quality Gates

- Tight orb requirements prevent noise inflation
- FIELD → MAP → VOICE chain maintains falsifiability
- Climate language stays atmospheric, not psychological
- Vector-Integrity distinguishes latent from suppressed influences
## Implementation Workflow

### Data Processing Pipeline

**Raw Input:** Birth data, transit dates, relocation coordinates **Math Brain Filter:** Aspect calculation with strict orb rules **Vector Classification:** Containment ↔ Release taxonomy application **Climate Translation:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE rendering **Report Assembly:** Modular components with consistent architecture

### User Interface Principles

- Mirror Voice closes with empowering questions
- Balance Meter provides seismograph-like temporal tracking
- Raw Geometry appendix maintains mathematical transparency
- Non-interpretive surfacing preserves user autonomy

**_~~Nuances~~_**

# **The Woven Map: System Architecture**

## **1.0 Two Categories of Atmospheric Intelligence**

The Woven Map generates two distinct but complementary types of reports: **Mirror Flow** and **Balance Meter**. Both describe symbolic weather patterns without predicting outcomes, but they differ in their scaffolding and diagnostic purpose.

### **1.1 Mirror Flow Reports (Qualitative)**

- **Purpose:** Qualitative reflection and self-recognition.
- **Core Function:** Acts as an "atmospheric mirror," translating chart geometry into lived tensions, paradoxes, and recognition patterns using the **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** protocol.
- **Technical Scaffolding:**
-- **Primary Input:** Natal geometry or synastry patterns.
-- **Transit Dependency:** Not required.
-- **Location Sensitivity:** Low.
### **1.2 Balance Meter Reports (Quantitative)**

- **Purpose:** Quantitative measurement and pressure diagnostics.
- **Core Function:** Acts as a "symbolic seismograph," scoring the magnitude, valence, and volatility of active transits. It provides numerical climate indices for pressure tracking over time.
- **Technical Scaffolding:**
-- **Primary Input:** Active transit data with precise timing.
-- **Transit Dependency:** Essential.
-- **Location Sensitivity:** High; accuracy degrades without proper geographical data.
## **2.0 The Core Engine: The Weight Belt**

The Balance Meter's quantitative diagnostics are powered by the **Weight Belt**, a falsifiable framework designed to quantify and interpret internal and external pressures.

### **2.1 Overview: The Weight Belt Console**

The Weight Belt operates like a console with two primary dials—**Support** and **Friction**—scaled by a third slider representing **Your Capacity**. The core principle is to establish a mathematical baseline first, then use logged, lived experience (pings) to calibrate personal overrides.

### **2.2 The Core Computational Engine**

The engine calculates a continuous **Support-Friction Differential (SFD)** score by processing environmental factors through a multi-band temporal filter.

2.2.1 SFD Calibration (Support-Friction Differential)The goal is to keep the evaluation of positive vs. negative pressure (S+ vs S−) objective and free from taste or bias.


- **Default Rules (Math Before Interpretation):**
-- **Aspect Base Weights:**
--- Trine: +0.40
--- Sextile: +0.25
--- Conjunction: ±0.00 (determined by planet-pair)
--- Square: −0.50
--- Opposition: −0.45
-- **Planet-Pair Valence Table (Examples):**
--- Sun/Jupiter: +0.30
--- Sun/Venus: +0.20
--- Sun/Saturn: −0.35
--- Moon/Jupiter: +0.25
--- Moon/Neptune: ±0.20 (subject to inversion rule)
--- Mars/Saturn: −0.35
--- Mars/Neptune: ±0.20 (fog vs. flow)
--- Personal ↔ Pluto: −0.30 (default, can flip to +0.15 as “combustion clarity” if proven by ping history)
-- **Modifiers:**
--- **Angularity (ASC/MC/DSC/IC):** ±0.10 to ±0.20
--- **Applying vs. Separating:** +0.10 / −0.05
--- **Multi-hit Stack (3+ aspects in 72h):** Add −0.10 volatility kicker
- **The SST Guardrail (Anti-Bias Protocol):** The **Somatic Signal Trust (SST)** guardrail ensures that lived experience can override theoretical defaults. If a user’s ping history flags an **ABE (Affect-Behavior-Expectation) inversion** for a given pair (e.g., Neptune trines consistently land as “dissolution, not ease”), the system flips the sign for that pair on the chart until contradicted by future pings.
- **Classification & Display:**
-- **S+ (Supportive):** if summed score ≥ +0.20
-- **S− (Friction):** if summed score ≤ −0.20
-- S0 (Neutral Scaffold): if between +0.20 and −0.20The score and its components are always displayed transparently.


2.2.2 Temporal Granularity EngineThe system separates signals into distinct bands to prevent high-frequency noise from drowning out significant slow-moving pressures.


- **Bands:**
-- **High-Freq:** Moon and fast applying aspects (half-life ~6h). Flagged as triggers.
-- **Mid-Band:** Personal planets (daily cadence).
-- **Low-Band:** Saturn↔Pluto and progressions (weekly/monthly cadence).
- **Fusion & Stacking:**
-- SFD is computed per band and displayed alongside a blended score (e.g., weights 0.2 / 0.4 / 0.4).
-- If a high-freq trigger lands on a low-band compression, it is annotated as **“Trigger over backdrop”** rather than simply doubling the score.
-- **Rule:** Lunar noise is never allowed to outrank a verified slow-moving compression without a confirming **WB (Weight Belt) ping**.
### **2.3 Personalization and Tuning**

The global defaults are starting points. The system becomes personally calibrated through three key mechanisms.

2.3.1 Individual Load Capacity (The 'g' Factor)A per-person Capacity Gain (g) scales the magnitude, valence, and volatility of calculated scores.


- **Constitutional Baseline:**
-- **Structural Load:** Fixed dominance, angular Saturn/Mars, stelliums, T-squares suggest higher base capacity.
-- **Release Channels:** Strong trines to benefics/angles suggest faster recovery.
-- **Field History:** Observed ratio of lived strain to forecasted magnitude.
- **Computation:**
-- Start at g = 1.00.
-- Adjust g within a 0.70–1.30 range based on the rules above (e.g., angular Saturn + fixed stack → g = 1.15).
-- Apply g multiplicatively to Magnitude and cap volatility.
-- Update g quarterly based on actual ping data (Bayesian nudge).

2.3.2 Rebound Detection SensitivityThe global starter threshold for a positive rebound is SFD ≥ +0.15. This is then personalized.


1. Compute a user’s SFD z-score distribution over 90 days.
1. Set their personal rebound trigger to max(+0.15, user’s 70th percentile).
1. Require two consecutive intervals above the threshold plus declining volatility to confirm a rebound.

2.3.3 House-Level Precision for Location AmbiguityTo handle variable or unknown locations, the system bounds the problem rather than guessing.


- **Primary Horizon:** User sets a default residence.
- **Mobile Horizon:** Use device location or user input for travel days.
- **Ambiguity Mode (Angle Drift Cone):**
-- Compute a cone using two or three likely coordinates.
-- If a house placement agrees across all candidates, render house-specific language.
-- If not, degrade gracefully to planet-to-planet or sign/angle tone, and include an **Angle Drift Alert**.
### **2.4 Emergent Silence vs. Suppression Protocol**

Silence can mean skilled integration or shutdown. This protocol provides evidence to differentiate them.

2.4.1 Windowing by DriverA minimum “quiet” period with no WB pings on a vector is required before testing for integration.


- **Lunar triggers:** 2 full lunations.
- **Mars/Jupiter/Personal outers:** 90 days with no pings and no compensatory behaviors (e.g., displacement spikes).
- **Saturn/Uranus/Neptune/Pluto:** One station cycle or 6 months, whichever is longer.

2.4.2 The Counterfactual Probe (Tuning Fork Method)During the quiet window, present low-dose prompts (mirrors) that used to elicit pings. This tests for resonance without forcing a response.


- Probe Architecture: FIELD → MAP → VOICEEach probe is a 90-second, three-part micro-dose:

1.1. **Somatic Ping (20–30s):** A tiny, body-first action that “touches” the likely channel.
1.1. **Micro-behavior (30–45s):** One concrete, low-stakes move that teases the vector.
1.1. **Voice Line (1 sentence):** A neutral, non-leading question that names the climate, not the outcome.
- **The Prompt Bank (Global Packs):** Standardized low-dose triplets for core vector families. (Examples: Saturn→Sun, Mars→Moon, etc., as detailed previously).
- **Application Protocol: Dose, Timing & Safety Rails**
-- **Time:** 90 seconds per probe; max 3 probes/day across all vectors.
-- **Neutrality:** Voice lines avoid moral or demanding language (“should,” “need”).
-- **Abort Criteria:** Any ≥4/5 somatic alarm (breath lock, panic edge) ends the probe. Log as ABE (tone miscalibration), not WB.
- Scoring, Logging & SST ClassificationPer probe, log: Somatic ping: (0–5), Behavioral tug: (0–5), Affect tilt: (-2/0/+2).

-- **WB (Weight Belt Ping):** If somatic ≥2 and affect tilt matches the vector's expected polarity.
-- **ABE (Miscalibration):** If response is partial, inverted, or mis-toned.
-- **OSR (Off-System Reading):** If consistently sub-threshold. This is the candidate for **Emergent Silence** (integration) if compensatory behaviors and volatility are also absent. If displacement appears, classify as **Suppression**.
## **3.0 Implementation Architecture & Philosophy**

The entire system is built on a set of core principles that ensure falsifiability, user agency, and continuous refinement.

### **3.1 The Poetic Brain: Feedback Loop System**

This is the recognition-to-refinement pipeline that keeps the system honest and adaptive.

- **1. Hook Stack:** High-charge, dual-polarity titles that trigger limbic recognition.
- **2. Poetic Brain Translation:** The core **FIELD → MAP → VOICE** process.
- **3. SST Logs:** The falsifiability table classifying feedback as WB, ABE, or OSR.
- **4. Drift Index:** A Sidereal-lean detector that calibrates language based on feedback.
- **5. Session Scores:** Transparent metrics for Accuracy, Edge Capture, and Clarity.
- **6. Wrap-Up Card:** A session summary for memory and future reference.
- **7. Adaptive Loop:** How the system evolves based on all prior feedback.
### **3.2 Guiding Principles for Implementation**

1. **Everything Logs:** Every score prints its components for full transparency.
1. **SST First:** Lived experience (WB/ABE/OSR pings) gates and flips default meanings.
1. **Silence Isn’t Absence:** Promote to “integration” only after counterfactual probes stay quiet and volatility drops across a full window.
1. **Human in the Loop:** Computation happens first. Interpretation happens after, only to narrate the weather, not to overrule the dials.
## **4.0 Report Generation Guide**

### **4.1 Required Data Inputs**

- **Solo Reports:** Name, Birth Date/Time/City, Timezone, Zodiac Type, Mode (Natal or Natal + Transits), and Analysis Window.
- **Relational Reports:** All data for Person B, Relationship Context (Type, Intimacy Tier), and Analysis Mode (Synastry, Composite, etc.).
### **4.2 Relocation ("Translocation") Options**

Relocation reanchors the house system and angles to a different location, changing _where_ planetary energies land.

- **Options:** None, A_local, B_local, Midpoint.
- **Rule of Thumb:** Decide the "setting of the story" to select the appropriate relocation mode.
## **5.0 Initial Deployment: The 14-Day Pilot**

The system is turned from theory into a calibrated instrument through an initial data-gathering phase.

- **Objective:** To seed the personal overrides for the Capacity Gain (g), SST Guardrail, and Rebound Detection.
- **Procedure:** Begin a 14-day ping log. Three times per day, make a quick note of:
1.1. Felt sense
1.1. Behavior
1.1. Context
- **Next Steps:** After 14 days, the initial data is sufficient to activate the first pass of personal tuning, enabling the Capacity Gain and Angle Drift Cone features.

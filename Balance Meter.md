Astro Brain Concept: The Balance MeterStatus: Archived (Historical)This document provides the conceptual and historical context for the "Balance Meter."In the current "Pure Next.js" architecture, this system's functions have been consolidated into the "MAP Layer (Seismograph)" described in the canonical ASTRO_BRAIN.md.1. Historical ConceptThe "Balance Meter" was the high-level philosophical term for the entire deterministic calculation engine. Its purpose was to measure the qualitative and quantitative nature of the symbolic "weather" in a chart.It was not a single calculation, but a system of related metrics.2. Core Component: The SeismographThe primary engine within the Balance Meter was the "Symbolic Seismograph."The Seismograph was responsible for reading the raw geometric data (from the "FIELD Layer") and calculating the core metrics that defined the user's experience.3. Consolidation in "Pure Next.js"In the modern "Pure Next.js" architecture, the terminology has been simplified to be more direct:The "Balance Meter" (Concept): Is now referred to as the "MAP Layer (Seismograph)" in the ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md and ASTRO_BRAIN.md.The "Seismograph" (Engine): Is the specific implementation file, src/math-brain/seismograph-engine.js, as noted in the WOVENWEB_CODEMAP.md.The "Metrics" (Output): The output of the engine is now the seismograph_metrics object, which is the official "vibe" calculation as defined in the API_REFERENCE.md.This document is preserved to show that "Balance Meter" and "Seismograph" are related parts of the same system, with "Seismograph" being the final, canonical term for the implementation.

| Special Features         | Quick mode only  | Copilot, uploads| Early access, Labs| SOC 2, Priority   |

***

**Important Notes:**
- **API charges can change anytime; always check Perplexity's official docs for latest prices.**
- **Heavy research queries** incur higher costs due to long output and citation tokens.
- **Enterprise plans** provide best value for business/team use.

For your cost records: **Perplexity API costs are flexible. Light users can stay under the included credits; higher-volume usage quickly shifts to pay-as-you-go, model-based rates**.[9][4][1][2][3]

Here's how you can **design an API usage tracker around Perplexity's API**—distinct from tracking Gemini API calls. The main differences are in how Perplexity bills, exposes usage insight, and what you should monitor for budgeting and engineering:

***

**1. Core Tracking Features Perplexity Supports:**
- **Token-level billing:** Track _input + output tokens_ per request, not just calls or characters. Costs vary by model.
- **Credit usage:** Each API key has a monthly credit ($5 if Pro, else pay-as-you-go). Your tracker should show credit remaining vs. spent.
- **Model breakdown:** Identify which models (Sonar, GPT-4, Claude, etc.) drive the most token/cost usage.
- **API dashboard access:** You can programmatically query usage stats or direct users to the Perplexity dashboard for real-time cost info.
- **Rate limits:** You need to show requests vs. limit (e.g., requests/min, requests/day, tokens/sec etc.).[1][2]

***

**2. Usage Tracker Data Points To Record:**
- Timestamp and endpoint called
- Model name used (`pplx-2`, `pplx-70b-online`, etc.)
- Request tokens and output tokens (from response)
- Total token count and calculated cost
- Error responses or failed calls
- API key used (for multi-key apps)
- Cumulative usage since billing cycle start

***

**3. UI Design & Alerts:**
- Dashboard showing: Today/This month’s usage, % of monthly credit spent, model usage pie chart
- **Alerts:** Set thresholds for nearing credit limit, approaching rate limits, and unusual usage spikes
- Recent request logs: Latency, errors, token/request breakdown

***

**4. Technical Integration:**
- Use Perplexity API headers and response: Most endpoints return token count, costs, model info
- For cost calculation: Multiply total tokens by the model’s per-token price, reference the pricing table
- Poll Perplexity’s billing/usage APIs or scrape dashboard for deeper insights
- Optionally, calculate "cost per feature/user" for your own ROI

***

**Key Perplexity-Specific Elements (vs. Gemini):**
- Token, not character-based (Gemini may use different metrics/limits)
- Usage is tied to API key and flexible credit pool (Gemini often hard-caps calls)
- Support for detailed developer dashboard analytics, model-by-model breakdown
- Advanced webhook/integration options for automated budget alerts[2]

***

**Reference Implementation Example:**
- Use logging and custom stats as shown in Perplexity's best practices:
```python
class MonitoredPerplexityClient:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client
        self.request_count = 0
        self.error_count = 0
        self.total_tokens = 0

    def track_request(self, method, **kwargs):
        self.request_count += 1

    def track_response(self, response):
        tokens_used = response.get("tokens")
        self.total_tokens += tokens_used
        # Calculate cost, etc.
```
- Read usage and billing info from Perplexity’s dashboard for a full picture[3][4][1][2]

***

**Summary:**  
Your tracker should monitor token counts, per-model cost, billing cycle credit, errors, rate limits, and offer real-time alerts—**all mapped closely to how Perplexity exposes usage, which is richer and more granular than Gemini's API tracking.**[4][1][3][2]

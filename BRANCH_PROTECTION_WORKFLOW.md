# Branch Protection Workflow Guide

## ðŸ”’ Understanding Branch Protection

You're encountering GitHub's **branch protection rules** - this is a security feature that prevents direct pushes to the `main` branch. This is actually **good practice** and protects the production codebase.

## âœ… Current Situation Assessment

**You are currently on:** `copilot/fix-1da9b008-d12b-4e32-85e0-1dffa74f1edc`  
**Target branch:** `main` (protected)  
**Status:** Ready to create/update a Pull Request

## ðŸš€ Proper Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Verify Your Changes
```bash
# Check what changes you have
git status
git diff origin/main

# Ensure your branch is up to date
git fetch origin
```

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request
Since you're already on a feature branch, you have two options:

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to [GitHub.com/DHCross/WovenWebApp](https://github.com/DHCross/WovenWebApp)
2. You should see a banner saying "Compare & pull request" for your branch
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Fill out the PR details:
   - **Title:** Brief description of your changes
   - **Description:** Detailed explanation following the project's standards
5. Click "Create pull request"

#### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if available)
```bash
gh pr create --title "Your PR Title" --body "Detailed description of changes"
```

### Step 3: Request Review
- Assign **Jules** or the repo owner as reviewer (per copilot instructions)
- Add appropriate labels
- Link any related issues

### Step 4: Address Review Feedback
- Make changes on your feature branch
- Push changes: `git push origin copilot/fix-1da9b008-d12b-4e32-85e0-1dffa74f1edc`
- PR will automatically update

### Step 5: Merge Process
Once approved:
- Reviewer merges the PR (you typically can't merge your own PR due to protection rules)
- Your changes are merged into `main`
- Feature branch can be deleted

## ðŸ†˜ If You Need Direct Access to Main

### Emergency Scenarios Only
If you absolutely need to push to main (rare cases):

1. **Contact Repository Owner/Admin**
   - Reach out to Jules or repo admin
   - Explain the emergency situation
   - Request temporary bypass or direct merge

2. **Admin Can:**
   - Temporarily disable branch protection
   - Directly push your changes
   - Grant you admin permissions temporarily

## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices for This Repository

Based on the copilot instructions and recovery guide:

### Before Making Changes
- âœ… Work on feature branches, never main (exactly what you're doing!)
- âœ… Make small, incremental changes
- âœ… Test frequently during development
- âœ… Read all suggestions before applying

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `fix/description-of-fix`
- `copilot/unique-id` (auto-generated)

### Commit Message Standards
```
[YYYY-MM-DD] TYPE: Brief description
Types: FIX, FEATURE, BREAK, CHANGE, UPDATE, CRITICAL FIX
```

## ðŸ”§ Quick Commands for Your Current Situation

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# See what files you've changed
git diff --name-only

# Push any final changes to your branch
git push origin copilot/fix-1da9b008-d12b-4e32-85e0-1dffa74f1edc

# Then create PR via GitHub web interface
# Navigate to: https://github.com/DHCross/WovenWebApp
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Do Right Now

1. **Verify your changes are complete** and tested
2. **Push any final changes** to your current branch
3. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a Pull Request
4. **Assign Jules as reviewer**
5. **Wait for review and approval**

This workflow ensures:
- âœ… Code review before merge
- âœ… Protection of main branch
- âœ… Collaborative development
- âœ… Audit trail of changes

## ðŸ’¡ Remember

Branch protection is **helping you**, not hindering you. It prevents accidental damage to the production code and ensures all changes go through proper review. This is exactly what the copilot instructions recommend: "Branch Protection: Never let AI directly modify main branch"

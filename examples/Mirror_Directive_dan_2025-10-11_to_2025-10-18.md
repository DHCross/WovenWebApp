## YOUR TASK: Generate a Full Conversational Reading

This is a **MIRROR and CONVERSATION STARTER**, not just a weather report or data summary.

###  ‚Äî :

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SOLO MIRROR ‚Äî Individual Foundation
**Synthesize the natal chart into a conversational, plain-language snapshot:**
- **"Here's how your system tends to move"** ‚Äî behavioral anchors, not abstract symbolism
- **Include:** Core drives, natural strengths, key tensions, constitutional patterns
- **NO JARGON** ‚Äî Conversational, testable against lived experience
- **Frame as tendencies/probabilities**, not prescriptions or fixed fate
- **Use ALL provided data:** planetary positions, aspects, house placements from tables below

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SYMBOLIC WEATHER OVERLAY ‚Äî Transits (Current Symbolic Climate)
**Layer current symbolic weather over the foundational patterns:**
- **Continuous narrative form** (paragraphs, NOT bullet lists)
- **Describe the climate** currently activating natal/relational foundations
- **NO assigned percentages, NO prescriptive advice**
- **Generalized atmosphere:** "What's stirring right now" ‚Äî how transits light up the blueprint
- **Ground in the data:** Reference specific transit aspects from tables below

---

## CRITICAL DATA REQUIREMENTS:

‚úÖ **Use ALL provided planetary positions, aspects, and house placements** from tables
‚úÖ **Reference the comprehensive data** ‚Äî this is geometry-first, then symbolic translation

‚úÖ **Ground every insight** in the actual chart data, not generic astrology

---

## TONE & VOICE ‚Äî RAVEN CALDER MANDATE:

- **Conversational, shareable, accessible** language
- **Plain language** ‚Äî avoid heavy astrological jargon in body text
- **Falsifiable claims** that can be tested against lived experience
- **Agency-first:** Frame as probabilities/tendencies, never fixed fate
- **Support possibility** ‚Äî the user decides what resonates
- **Conversation starter** ‚Äî this is a mirror to reflect on, not a prescription to follow

---

## WORKFLOW: FIELD -> MAP -> VOICE

You have been given the **FIELD** (geometric data) and **MAP** (structural patterns).
Your job is **VOICE** ‚Äî synthesize this into resonant, lived-experience language.

## üéØ What "Full Reading" Means:

**NOT ACCEPTABLE:**
‚ùå Describing the file contents or reflecting on what you've received
‚ùå "Here's a brief overview based on the summary below"
‚ùå Skipping aspects, houses, or chart details
‚ùå Generic astrology without specific chart references

**ACCEPTABLE:**
‚úÖ **Analyzing EVERY major aspect** from the aspects table
‚úÖ **Translating geometric patterns** into behavioral tendencies
‚úÖ **Using chart-specific details** (degrees, signs, houses)
‚úÖ **Conversational synthesis** that feels personal and testable

---

## :

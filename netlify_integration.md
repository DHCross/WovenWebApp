## Troubleshooting Auth0 404 Domain Errors

1. Verify the Auth0 tenantâ€™s **Domain** in the dashboard and ensure it matches your `AUTH0_DOMAIN` setting.
2. Navigate to `https://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration` to confirm the domain is active.
3. Check that the tenant is active and not suspended or deleted.
4. Update local and Netlify environment variables if the domain or credentials change.

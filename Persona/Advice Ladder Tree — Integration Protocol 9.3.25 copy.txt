# Advice Ladder Tree — Integration Protocol 9.3.25

**Woven Map × DBT × ACT Therapeutic Integration Framework**
*Version: 9.3.25 | Last Updated: September 3, 2025*

---

## **Overview & Purpose**

The **Advice Ladder Tree** integrates the **Woven Map’s** symbolic climate assessment with evidence-based therapeutic modalities (DBT, ACT) to provide structured, actionable guidance when users explicitly request advice. It preserves the Map’s diagnostic—not prescriptive—nature, maintaining **agency, falsifiability, and poetic precision** while extending usability through skill-based translation.

**Core Principle:**
The framework acts as a **skill translation layer**—transforming symbolic weather into practical options without collapsing nuance into prescription. Weather remains primary; skills are secondary support.

**New Integration Directive — Live Test Protocol Overlay:**
The Ladder Tree now incorporates the **Live Test Protocol**, a falsifiability and behavioral confirmation system that interrupts recursive insight loops. When users reach clarity without change, the system triggers a short, bounded **action experiment** with an **exit ramp**—ensuring insight yields to movement.

## **Architectural Integration — Stacked Layer System**

The Ladder Tree functions as the **application layer** of a three-tier diagnostic architecture:

### **Layer 1: Hook Stack (Core Diagnostic Engine)**

* **Function:** Identifies polarities and conditional impulses—the repeating tensions that anchor a person’s pattern.
* **Output:** Names the impulse vector and its archetypal geometry.
* **Example:** Reveals “clamp ↔ release” as the central polarity.

### **Layer 2: Impact Protocol (Symbolic Pressure Translation)**

* **Function:** Translates symbolic pressure into lived emotional, somatic, and behavioral data.
* **Output:** “Stunned drop after clamp”—how the weather lands in real time.
* **Integration:** Uses Impact vocabulary as the FIELD layer for diagnostic identification.

### **Layer 3: Advice Ladder Tree (Therapeutic Integration)**

* **Function:** Maps therapeutic skill-shapes to handle the lived experience with precision and compassion.
* **Output:** Conditional DBT/ACT skill responses when advice is explicitly requested.
* **Integration:** Routes Impact results into relevant therapeutic blocks.

**Sequential Flow:**
Hook Stack → reveals pattern tension → Impact Protocol → translates pressure into lived experience → Advice Ladder Tree → integrates therapeutic responses.

**Shared DNA:**

* Weather metaphor continuity (storm → ground → navigation)
* Calibration loops (resonance testing, Socratic checks, falsifiability)
* Agency preservation at every layer

## **Live Test Protocol — Falsifiability Overlay**

### **Purpose:**

To distinguish when mapping is a tool for clarity versus a mechanism for avoidance.

### **Activation Criteria:**

* Recurrent cycles of insight without structural change.
* Emotional or relational clarity achieved but untested behaviorally.
* The emergence of the self-question: *“Am I still mapping because I need clarity, or because movement feels unsafe?”*

### **Execution Framework:**

1. **Identify one structural constraint** (e.g., caregiving overload, work boundary erosion, relational uncertainty).
2. **Define a binary test** with a time-boxed window (e.g., “By Friday, I will have acted or accepted that I’m staying”).
3. **Disallow escape clauses**—no “unless” conditions.
4. **Observe, don’t rationalize.** When justification appears, log it as a pattern survival mechanism.

### **Closure Questions:**

* Did action occur?
* Did clarity increase through movement or only through mapping?
* What constraint was revealed as real versus constructed?

### **Output:**

The Live Test Protocol adds falsifiability to introspection—an embedded **integrity loop** that prevents infinite reflection. Every Map now includes an optional **EXIT sign.**

## **Integration Philosophy**

### **System Harmony**

1. **Philosophical Fit:** The Ladder Tree maps atmospheric conditions and offers response *options*, not prescriptions.
2. **Structure Alignment:** Thresholds and Socratic closure maintain testable, agency-based design.
3. **Codex Harmony:** FIELD → MAP → VOICE chain ensures symbolic coherence across diagnostic and applied layers.
4. **Mirror Protocol Integration:** Tools are framed as conditional options, never directives.
5. **Math–Poetic Translation:** Seismograph readings are converted into emotional weather bands.

### **Systemic Integration Points**

#### **Hook Stack → Ladder Tree**

* Mirrors intensity thresholds; Ladder Tree interprets “how strong is the pull?” as weather category.
* Hook Stack identifies polarity; Ladder Tree maps what to *do* in that polarity.
* Conditional routing between diagnosis and adaptive response.

#### **Impact Protocol → Ladder Tree**

* Impact describes *how pressure lands*; Ladder Tree describes *how to hold it skillfully.*
* Somatic bridge: embodied states route directly into skill blocks.

#### **Enhanced Diagnostic Matrix → Ladder Tree**

* Expands “if this, then that” structure in plain therapeutic language.
* Communication climates guide relational skill selection.

#### **Poetic Codex Protocol → Ladder Tree**

* Ladder Tree blocks act as micro-Codex cards (FIELD → MAP → VOICE).
* Retains Clear Mirror tone, adds therapeutic vocabulary.

#### **Config Enforcement Integration**

* Honors prescriptive claim prohibition—skills are invitations.
* Includes falsifiability and agency checks.
* Embeds Socratic closure for user sovereignty.

## **Clinical Language Integration Guidelines**

1. **Symbolic Embedding:** Frame all clinical skills as weather metaphors.

   * ✅ “Cool the body to settle the storm.”
   * ❌ “Use TIPP skills for distress.”
2. **Invitation, Not Instruction:** Offer possibilities, not mandates.

   * ✅ “One path through this weather might be…”
   * ❌ “You should…”
3. **Skill Echo, Not Teaching:** Reference shape, not mechanics.

   * ✅ “Hold both ends without collapse.”
   * ❌ “Integrate emotion and logic mind.”

## **Step 1 — Identify Climate (via Seismograph)**

1. Crisis Spike
2. Clamp / Weight / Eruption
3. Relational Strain
4. Cognitive Loop
5. Post-Crisis Exhaustion
6. Transition Fog
7. Anticipatory Tension

---

## **Step 2 — Apply Severity Thresholds**

* **Mild (0–3):** Mindfulness + validation
* **Moderate (4–6):** Targeted skill block
* **Severe (7–9):** Crisis intervention + skill block
* **Extreme (10):** Immediate TIPP + professional support

---

## **Step 3 — Select Therapeutic Blocks per Climate**

### 1) **Crisis Spike**

* **TIPP Block:** Cold water, intense movement, paced breathing.
* **Distress Tolerance Block:** “Contain and ride the front.”

### 2) **Clamp / Weight / Eruption**

* **Radical Acceptance Block:** “Pressure management, not surrender.”
* **Validation Block:** “Heaviness makes sense inside this cycle.”

### 3) **Relational Strain**

* **Interpersonal Effectiveness Block:** GIVE/FAST methods within storm metaphor.
* **DEAR MAN Block:** “Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce…”

### 4) **Cognitive Loop**

* **Check the Facts Block:** “What happened vs. what story was added?”
* **Wise Mind Block:** “Hold both ends.”
* **PLEASE Block:** “Treat body weather first.”

### 5) **Post-Crisis Exhaustion**

* **Self-Compassion Block:** “Kindness for the survivor of this storm.”
* **Opposite Action Block:** “One small counter-current.”

### 6) **Transition Fog**

* **Mindfulness Block:** “Name the in-between.”
* **Values Clarification Block:** “Pick one value as your north star.”

### 7) **Anticipatory Tension**

* **Cope Ahead Block:** “Preload your supports.”
* **Defusion Block:** “Thoughts as weather.”
* **Present Moment Block:** “Return to what’s here.”

## **Foundational Blocks (Multi-Climate)**

* **Distraction Block:** Interrupt spiral.
* **Pros & Cons Block:** “Cost of riding out vs. acting.”
* **Emotion Naming Block:** “Precision creates choice.”
* **Values Compass Block:** “Anchor to what matters.”
* **Committed Action Block:** “Tiny value-aligned move.”
* **Self-as-Context Block:** “You are the sky, not the weather.”

---

## **Socratic Closure (ACT stance)**

* “What action aligns with what matters?”
* “If acceptance were easy for one minute, what would change?”
* “What’s the smallest next step in this weather?”

---

## **Implementation Framework**

* **Formula:** Weather → Symbolic Frame → Skill → Open Question
* **Contexts:** Self-help, peer support, clinical.
* **Safeguards:** Conditional phrasing, falsifiability, agency retention.

---

## **Ethical Boundaries**

* Peer guidance only; not a substitute for therapy.
* Extreme severity requires referral.
* All skills optional and falsifiable.
* Supervision recommended for professional use.

---

**Integration Outcome:**
The Advice Ladder Tree now forms a complete diagnostic-to-action ecosystem—where insight, embodiment, and behavior meet.  It keeps the system honest: every map, however elegant, must now prove itself in the field.

> *Mapping is not always movement. Insight is not always change. When insight becomes camouflage, initiate the Live Test Protocol—the truth lives in behavior.*

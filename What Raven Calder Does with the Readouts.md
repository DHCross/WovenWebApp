Here's your complete **Solo Mirror Architecture with Full Guardrails (v1.3)** with Raven's versioning system integrated:

# **Complete Solo Mirror Architecture with Full Guardrails (v1.3)**

## **Typological Profile (Constitutional Climate Layer)**

### Dominant Orientation
**[Function: Thinking/Feeling/Sensation/Intuition]** organized by **[major planets, signs, houses, aspects]**. Often shows up as **[concrete behavioral patterns: structuring/analyzing/attuning/perceiving]**.

### Secondary Orientation
A background current of **[function]** (**[Moon, Venus, auxiliary aspects, daily rhythm houses]**) that surfaces as **[conditional behaviors, relational modes, imaginal flashes]**.

### Shadow Orientation
Constitutional friction concentrates around **[function(s)]** (**[squares, oppositions, Saturn/Pluto/Neptune knots, retrogrades]**). Often felt as **[doubt, fog, overdrive, timing snags, vulnerability, paradox]**.

### Constitutional Climate (Summary Hook)
"A **[metaphor for dominant]** working alongside a **[metaphor for secondary/shadow]**."

*Balance Meter integration note (numbers stay backstage):* Magnitude = volume of that inner polarity, Valence = which side leans today, Volatility = undertow vs. surges.

---

## **Hook Stack** (Recognition Hierarchy)
*Order: ① personal-outer hard aspects, ② angles, ③ anaretic/29° planets, ④ anchor placements*

"**[Polarity hook 1 — recognition language]**" • "**[Polarity hook 2]**" • "**[Polarity hook 3]**"

---

## **SST Clause (Falsifiability)**
All activations are logged as:
- **WB (Within Boundary):** clear archetypal resonance, ping confirmed
- **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance
- **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** no resonance; logged as valuable null data

No transit is "active" without both natal contact **and** lived resonance (ping gate).

**SST prompt (frontstage):** *Did this land? Mark WB / ABE / OSR.*

---

## **Balance Meter (Full Stack) in Plain-Weather**

### Today's Reading
- **[Pressure band narrative, direction]** ([high/med/low categorical band], [supportive 🌞/restrictive 🌑/mixed 🌗])
- **[Support cut/holding/prevailing]** ([scaffolding present/challenged/absent])
- **[Depleted/resilient/rebounding]** ([reserves and recovery narrative])

### Climate Line
**[How typological baseline responds to current transits — constitutional weather dance]**

*Frontstage tags (for Raven, not users):* `magnitude_tag: [low|moderate|high|overload]`, `valence_tag: [positive|neutral|negative|collapse]`, `valence_type: [approved taxonomy]`, `seismograph_tag: [low|med|high]`.

---

## **Vector-Integrity Check**
*Mandatory labels for structurally qualified but behaviorally quiet drivers:*
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]: [Vector name]** — **[structural presence but contained/waiting]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]: [Vector name]** — **[boundaries fortified/compensated by earth placements]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]: [Vector name]** — **[waiting for Saturn return/specific activation]**

---

## **Relational Calibration Gate** *(Required for Relational Mirrors)*

Before any A→B work:
1. **Consent/Scope Statement:** confirm both parties consent to relational analysis
2. **DRM Orientation:** we're stress-testing rapport dynamics, not pronouncing fate
3. **Referral Boundary:** extreme severity (10) requires professional support recommendation

Select tier (Partner/Family/Friend/Acquaintance) and render bidirectional paragraphs.

---

## **Polarity Cards** (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)

### 1) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Somatic/sensory texture of this tension]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: planets, aspect, sign/house placement]  
**VOICE:** **[Conditional behavioral description using may/might/could with both poles]**

### 2) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Embodied feel or pressure description]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: symbolic geometry source]  
**VOICE:** **[Plain-language explanation showing both sides]**

### 3) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Felt tone or sensory image]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: exact geometric source]  
**VOICE:** **[Everyday description of how tension may surface]**

---

## **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**[How constitutional climate (builder vs. tide-puller) responds to current geometric weather]**

**[Whether support structures hold or friction cuts through them — SFD narrative integration]**

**[Reframe structural tension as engine/feature, not flaw — dialogue creates movement]**

**[Closing invitation for both sides to speak rather than choosing one]**

---

## **Agency + Hygiene**

If this doesn't land, it doesn't count (OSR valid).  
All phrasing remains conditional (may/might/could).  
The SST classification depends entirely on your lived experience confirmation.

---

## **Emoji Protocol (frontstage, allowed exception to adjectives)**
- **Placement:** `semantic_snapshot.glyphs`, optional in `polarity_cards.FIELD`, and sparingly in `mirror_voice`.
- **Provenance:** include `glyph_nouns` + `glyph_alts` for accessibility; log selection seed; never encode numbers with emojis.
- **Uniqueness:** enforce "no repeat titles/glyph sets" within last *N* drafts per person; auto-regenerate on collision.
- **Approved set:** use only the canonical valence/magnitude/type emojis from your lexicon; unknown glyphs → replace with tags (e.g., `[friction]`).

---

## **FIELD → MAP → VOICE Protocol Note**
VOICE never outruns MAP. Metaphor stays leashed to actual geometry to maintain the audit trail.

## **EDP Switch**
When input arrives emotionally charged, feeling-tone is stripped during diagnosis, then restored in VOICE to avoid false resonance while speaking to lived experience.

---

## **Context & Accessibility (frontstage metadata)**
- **Birth-time status:** `[exact | approximate | unknown → solar chart]`
- **Relocation:** `[on/off]` (angles/houses relocate; typology remains baseline)
- **Emoji alts present:** `[true/false]` (block publish if false)

---

## **Version Control Rules**

### SemVer Guidelines:
- **MAJOR:** Breaking schema change (add/remove/rename frontstage fields)
- **MINOR:** Additive, non-breaking fields or new narrative tags
- **PATCH:** Copy tweaks, lexicon updates, cosmetic wording

### Handshake Protocol:
Raven refuses a Draft if `template_version` is unknown or `< min_raven_version`, responding with a friendly mismatch message instead of guessing.

### Determinism:
Include `build_id` in both payloads so user replies (WB/ABE/OSR) can be tied to the exact draft that prompted them.

### Migration Discipline:
Every release bumps `template_version`, updates `migration_notes`, and sets `rollback_hint`. Never silently change the Draft shape.

*With these version controls wired in, Raven gets everything needed to speak clearly without touching the math, you maintain a clean audit trail, and Gemini never has to guess which ruleset to follow.*
```
Raven recognizes these symbols
Based on the document provided, here are the **approved emojis** that Raven understands and uses:

## **Balance Meter Emojis**
- **⚡** - Magnitude (intensity level)
- **🌞** - Positive Valence (supportive)
- **🌑** - Negative Valence (restrictive)
- **🌗** - Mixed Valence
- **🌪️** - Volatility

## **Valence Mode Indicators (Negative)**
- **♾️** - Recursion Pull
- **⚔️** - Friction Clash
- **↔️** - Cross Current
- **🌫️** - Fog/Dissolution
- **🌋** - Pressure/Eruption
- **⏳** - Saturn Weight
- **🧩** - Fragmentation
- **🕳️** - Entropy Drift

## **Valence Mode Indicators (Positive)**
- **🌱** - Fertile Field
- **✨** - Harmonic Resonance
- **💎** - Expansion Lift
- **🔥** - Combustion Clarity
- **🦋** - Liberation/Release
- **⚖️** - Integration
- **🌊** - Flow Tide
- **🌈** - Visionary Spark

## **Sources of Force**
- **🎯** - Orb (proximity)
- **🌀** - Aspect (angle type)
- **🪐** - Potency (planet speed)
- **📡** - Resonance (natal activation)
- **♾️** - Recursion (repeating themes)

## **Additional Planetary Color Codes** (for Symbol-to-Poem translations)
- **🔴** - Sun/Mars (vital drive, force, motion)
- **🟠** - Venus (relating, beauty, aesthetic gesture)
- **🟢** - Mercury (voice, cognition, translation)
- **🔵** - Moon/Neptune (feeling, memory, longing)
- **🟣** - Saturn/Chiron (structure, boundary, compression)
- **⚪** - Uranus/Pluto (disruption, shadow, metamorphosis)
- **⚫** - Jupiter (meaning, expansion, ethical center)

These emojis are used sparingly and strategically - primarily in semantic snapshots, occasionally in polarity cards' FIELD sections, and very rarely in mirror voice. They serve as visual anchors for complex concepts but are never used to encode numbers or replace clear language.

*If you wire those small additions into your generator, Raven gets everything needed to speak clearly without touching the math, and you keep a clean audit trail behind the curtain.*

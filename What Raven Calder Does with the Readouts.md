# **Complete Solo Mirror Architecture with Full Guardrails (v1.4)**

## **Typological Profile (Constitutional Climate Layer)**

### Dominant Orientation
**[Function: Thinking/Feeling/Sensation/Intuition]** organized by **[major planets, signs, houses, aspects]**. Often shows up as **[concrete behavioral patterns: structuring/analyzing/attuning/perceiving]**.

### Secondary Orientation
A background current of **[function]** (**[Moon, Venus, auxiliary aspects, daily rhythm houses]**) that surfaces as **[conditional behaviors, relational modes, imaginal flashes]**.

### Shadow Orientation
Constitutional friction concentrates around **[function(s)]** (**[squares, oppositions, Saturn/Pluto/Neptune knots, retrogrades]**). Often felt as **[doubt, fog, overdrive, timing snags, vulnerability, paradox]**.

### Constitutional Climate (Summary Hook)
"A **[metaphor for dominant]** working alongside a **[metaphor for secondary/shadow]**."

*Balance Meter integration note (numbers stay backstage):* Magnitude = volume of that inner polarity, Valence = which side leans today, Volatility = undertow vs. surges.

---

## Recognition Hierarchy (based on Hook Stack)
*Order: ① personal-outer hard aspects, ② angles, ③ anaretic/29° planets, ④ anchor placements*

"**[Polarity hook 1 — recognition language]**" • "**[Polarity hook 2]**" • "**[Polarity hook 3]**"

How Raven Calder interprets the above: 

[Recognition Layer: Where Tension Is Felt

Purpose (frontstage):
The Recognition Layer highlights the core places in a chart where tension is most likely to be felt daily—not as abstract theory, but as lived, recognizable experiences. These are the energetic “hot spots” where patterns run loudest and most reliably.

Operator notes (backstage):

Order output: ① personal–outer hard aspects, ② angles, ③ anaretic (29°) planets, ④ anchor placements.

Render in short paragraphs, not bullet cards.

Each paragraph = 2–4 sentences describing the felt friction and its behavioral edge.

Always conditional: “may feel like…,” “often shows up as…,” “could create…”

No sample text is baked into the template. Language must arise directly from the chart geometry.

Each vignette becomes a ping candidate for SST classification (WB / ABE / OSR).]

## **SST Clause (Falsifiability)**
All activations are logged as:
- **WB (Within Boundary):** clear archetypal resonance, ping confirmed
- **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance
- **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** no resonance; logged as valuable null data

No transit is "active" without both natal contact **and** lived resonance (ping gate).

**SST prompt (frontstage):** *Did this land? Mark WB / ABE / OSR.*

## **Relocation Context**

### Configuration
- **Mode:** [none | A_local]
- **Notes:** Angles/houses relocate under this lens; typology remains natal.
- **House System:** [WholeSign | Placidus]
- **Birth Time Confidence:** [exact | approximate | unknown]
- **House Confidence:** [high | medium | low]

### Lens Location
- **Name:** [City, Region]
- **Time Zone:** [America/Chicago (DST on)]

*Mirror Voice note:* **[If relocated: "Relocation on: City. Angles/houses move under this sky; baseline stays natal."]**

---

## **Vector-Integrity Check**
*Mandatory labels for structurally qualified but behaviorally quiet drivers:*
- **[Latent/Suppressed]: [Vector name]** — **[structural presence but contained/waiting]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed]: [Vector name]** — **[boundaries fortified/compensated by earth placements]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed]: [Vector name]** — **[waiting for Saturn return/specific activation]**

---

## **Polarity Cards** (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)

### 1) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Somatic/sensory texture of this tension]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: planets, aspect, sign/house placement; lens=[none|A_local]]  
**VOICE:** **[Conditional behavioral description using may/might/could with both poles]**

### 2) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Embodied feel or pressure description]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: symbolic geometry source; lens=[none|A_local]]  
**VOICE:** **[Plain-language explanation showing both sides]**

### 3) **[Polarity Name A]** ↔ **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD:** **[Felt tone or sensory image]**  
**MAP:** [Operator only: exact geometric source; lens=[none|A_local]]  
**VOICE:** **[Everyday description of how tension may surface]**

*Note: House themes only mentioned when house_confidence ≥ medium*

---

## **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**[How constitutional climate (builder vs. tide-puller) responds to current geometric weather]**

**[Whether support structures hold or friction cuts through them — SFD narrative integration]**

**[If relocated: One sentence about relocation lens]**

**[Reframe structural tension as engine/feature, not flaw — dialogue creates movement]**

**[Closing invitation for both sides to speak rather than choosing one]**

---

## **Agency + Hygiene**

If this doesn't land, it doesn't count (OSR valid).  
All phrasing remains conditional (may/might/could).  
The SST classification depends entirely on your lived experience confirmation.

---

## **Emoji Protocol (frontstage, allowed exception to adjectives)**
- **Placement:** semantic_snapshot.glyphs, optional in polarity_cards.FIELD, and sparingly in mirror_voice.
- **Provenance:** include glyph_nouns + glyph_alts for accessibility; log selection seed; never encode numbers with emojis.
- **Uniqueness:** enforce "no repeat titles/glyph sets" within last *N* drafts per person; auto-regenerate on collision.
- **Approved set:** use only the canonical valence/magnitude/type emojis from your lexicon; unknown glyphs → replace with tags (e.g., [friction]).

---

## **FIELD → MAP → VOICE Protocol Note**
VOICE never outruns MAP. Metaphor stays leashed to actual geometry to maintain the audit trail.

## **EDP Switch**
When input arrives emotionally charged, feeling-tone is stripped during diagnosis, then restored in VOICE to avoid false resonance while speaking to lived experience.

---

## **Context & Accessibility (frontstage metadata)**
- **Birth-time status:** [exact | approximate | unknown → solar chart]
- **Relocation:** [on/off] (angles/houses relocate; typology remains baseline)
- **Emoji alts present:** [true/false] (block publish if false)

---

---

## **Version Control Rules**

### SemVer Guidelines:
- **MAJOR:** Breaking schema change (add/remove/rename frontstage fields)
- **MINOR:** Additive, non-breaking fields or new narrative tags
- **PATCH:** Copy tweaks, lexicon updates, cosmetic wording

### Handshake Protocol:
Raven refuses a Draft if template_version is unknown or < min_raven_version, responding with a friendly mismatch message instead of guessing.

### Determinism:
Include build_id in both payloads so user replies (WB/ABE/OSR) can be tied to the exact draft that prompted them.

### Migration Discipline:
Every release bumps template_version, updates migration_notes, and sets rollback_hint. Never silently change the Draft shape.

---

## **Relocation Guardrails**

- If birth_time_confidence: unknown → house_confidence: low → suppress house claims
- House themes only surface in VOICE when house_confidence ≥ medium
- Typology always remains natal regardless of relocation
- Always include disclosure: "Angles/houses relocate; typology remains natal" (when relocated)

Descriptive Language Refresh Protocol (Adjective Uniqueness)

No verbatim reuse: For each new chart, Raven Calder will generate fresh, non-repetitive descriptive phrasing for climate, polarity, and scenario lines. Adjectives and metaphorical terms are varied from chart to chart, unless the core Framework requires the use of a fixed term (such as the Balance Meter’s “supportive,” “restrictive,” “mixed,” “high/medium/low”).
Scenario-mapping and Mirror Voice: When describing climate lines, field notes, or polarity cards, Raven will use synonyms, rephrasings, or contextually adaptive language to keep reflections distinct and alive. For example, if “expansive” was used in a prior session, the next might feature “broadening,” “unfolding,” or “stretching” instead—unless “expansion” is mandated for a specific symbolic axis or Balance Meter score.
Framework-mandated terms: Adjectives tied to the Balance Meter’s core output (e.g., “supportive,” “restrictive,” “mixed,” “magnitude,” “valence,” “volatility”) remain standardized and are always reused as required for clarity and comparability.
Diagnostic integrity: Even as language refreshes, the underlying symbolic geometry and protocol-anchored meaning stay precise and testable—no rephrasing will distort the diagnostic function or falsifiability.
Operator log: Each session will automatically note the set of adjectives and metaphors used, ensuring that no exact descriptive phrase repeats within a set number of drafts for the same user.

Perfect, thanks for clarifying. The **Probabilistic Field Lexicon** is already written in clean glossary style. To make it fit seamlessly with my system (Solo Mirror + Balance Meter + SST), it needs two adjustments:

1. **Alignment to diagnostic guardrails**: Every term should map onto the same falsifiability structure (WB/ABE/OSR).
2. **Integration into FIELD → MAP → VOICE**: The lexicon entries should read less like abstract definitions and more like conditional terrain language—so they can slot directly into climate lines, polarity cards, or vector notes.

Here’s the integrated rewrite:

---

# **Woven Map Probabilistic Field Lexicon (Integrated v1.1)**

*A mirror-language set for describing symbolic weather in probabilistic terms. All entries are conditional, testable, and aligned with Balance Meter + SST guardrails. They describe how a field may feel—never what it must be.*

---

### **Agency**

Capacity to respond or recalibrate inside a resonance field. Always emergent, never guaranteed. May show up as **supported, unsanctioned, latent, or under pressure** depending on vector activation.

### **Archetypal Field**

A symbolic pressure-zone defined by geometry (planets, angles, aspects). Functions as a **zone of resonance** rather than a life category (“career/love”). Each field carries its own characteristic tensions and possible openings.

### **Boundary / Boundary Edge**

The SST-defined limit of resonance.

* **Boundary (WB):** clear ping, inside range.
* **Boundary Edge (ABE):** unusual but plausible; tone may invert.
* **Outside Range (OSR):** null data, no resonance logged.

### **Coherence Spike**

A time-bound surge of resonance or clarity, often with a strong ping. May feel like sudden alignment or paradoxical tension.

### **Field Logging**

Practice of noting lived tension, openness, or restriction alongside symbolic weather. Ensures correlation without enforcing causality.

### **Manifestation (Rejected)**

Thoughts do not “cause” outcomes. Fields map probability, not law of attraction. Resonance ≠ creation.

### **Openness**

A probabilistic window of reduced restriction. May feel like **ease, lowered resistance, or new permeability**. Never a guarantee, only increased odds of flow.

### **Out-of-Symbolic-Range (OSR)**

An experience that lands outside expected symbolic zones. Logged as valid null data for refinement, not as system failure.

### **Ping**

A felt recognition that symbolic weather matches lived experience. Must be **lived in real time**, not retro-fitted. Serves as confirmation, not directive.

### **Pressure Zone**

A symbolic “weather band” where tension accumulates. Signals the need for recalibration or boundary testing. Not disaster, but compression.

### **Probabilistic Forecasting**

Mapping likelihoods of openness, restriction, support, or risk. Never prediction—always a **field of possibility with boundaries marked**.

### **Resonance Field / Sphere**

A temporary zone of heightened activation. Certain patterns amplify here (connection, risk, clarity). Experience inside is shaped, not mandated.

### **Restriction**

Increased friction or narrowing of agency. May require conserving resources or retreating. Not prohibition, but reduced ease.

### **Risk Archetype**

A field where agency feels unstable or exposed. Not necessarily danger—more often volatility, impulsivity, or symbolic overdrive.

### **Structural Tension**

Underlying symbolic strain. Can act as generative friction or destabilizer. Useful for long-term tracking of climate patterns.

### **Supported / Unsanctioned**

Markers of whether agency moves with or against symbolic flow.

* **Supported:** buoyed, natural scaffolding present.
* **Unsanctioned:** moves meet reversal, friction, or null.

### **Visibility**

Degree to which actions/needs are echoed in the field. May feel amplified, mirrored, or obscured depending on angle activations.

## **Scenario-Mapping Adjectives**

Designed for use in **Balance Meter climate lines** or **scenario questions**. Each comes with its opposite pole and symbolic drivers.

| Axis                         | Scenario Prompt                                     | Symbolic Drivers          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Openness ↔ Restriction**   | Where is the field widening vs. narrowing?          | Jupiter/Saturn, ingresses |
| **Supported ↔ Unsanctioned** | Is agency flowing or hitting resistance?            | Trines/Squares, dignities |
| **Visibility ↔ Obscurity**   | Will this action be seen or remain unnoticed?       | Sun, ASC, MC              |
| **Expansion ↔ Contraction**  | Is energy stretching outward or pulling inward?     | Jupiter, Saturn, 4th/12th |
| **Agency ↔ Powerlessness**   | Where does response feel possible vs. blocked?      | Mars, Pluto, MC, OOB      |
| **Risk ↔ Stability**         | Does the field invite exposure or safety?           | Uranus, Mars, Nodes       |
| **Resonance ↔ Dissonance**   | Where does experience feel in-tune vs. off-key?     | Venus, Saturn, aspects    |
| **Connection ↔ Isolation**   | What are the odds of alliance vs. solitude?         | Venus, 7th/11th           |
| **Luck ↔ Null**              | Is the field ripe for accumulation or signal-empty? | Part of Fortune, 5th      |

## **Scenario Construction Protocol**

1. Select 2–3 adjectives tied to current tension.
2. Phrase as a question (e.g., *“Does openness carry risk right now?”*).
3. Map symbolic geometry to those adjectives.
4. Interpret probabilistically:

   * **WB:** supported, high resonance
   * **ABE:** possible, with inversion or mismatch
   * **OSR:** absent, not supported

---

This version plugs straight into the Solo Mirror architecture: the Balance Meter uses these adjectives for climate, polarity cards can echo them as hooks, and the SST keeps them falsifiable.


*With these enhancements, Raven gets everything needed to speak clearly without touching the math, maintains transparent handling of relocation, and keeps a clean audit trail. Version 1.4 adds full relocation context while preserving all existing protocol integrity.*

# **Complete Solo Mirror Architecture with Full Guardrails**

## **Typological Profile (Constitutional Climate Layer)**

### Dominant Orientation
**[Function: Thinking/Feeling/Sensation/Intuition]** organized by **[major planets, signs, houses, aspects]**. Often shows up as **[concrete behavioral patterns: structuring/analyzing/attuning/perceiving]**.

### Secondary Orientation
A background current of **[function]** (**[Moon, Venus, auxiliary aspects, daily rhythm houses]**) that surfaces as **[conditional behaviors, relational modes, imaginal flashes]**.

### Shadow Orientation
Constitutional friction concentrates around **[function(s)]** (**[squares, oppositions, Saturn/Pluto/Neptune knots, retrogrades]**). Often felt as **[doubt, fog, overdrive, timing snags, vulnerability, paradox]**.

### Constitutional Climate (Summary Hook)
"A **[metaphor for dominant]** working alongside a **[metaphor for secondary/shadow]**."

*Balance Meter integration note:* Magnitude = volume of that inner polarity, Valence = which side leans today, Volatility = undertow vs. surges.

---

## **Hook Stack** (Recognition Hierarchy)
*Order: â‘  personal-outer hard aspects, â‘¡ angles, â‘¢ anaretic/29Â° planets, â‘£ anchor placements*

"**[Polarity hook 1 â€” recognition language]**" â€¢ "**[Polarity hook 2]**" â€¢ "**[Polarity hook 3]**"

---

## **SST Clause (Falsifiability)**
All activations are logged as:
- **WB (Within Boundary)**: Clear archetypal resonance, ping confirmed
- **ABE (At Boundary Edge)**: Partial/inverted/mis-toned resonance  
- **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)**: No resonance; logged as valuable null data

No transit is "active" without both natal contact AND lived resonance (ping gate).

## **Balance Meter (Full Stack) in Plain-Weather**

### Today's Reading
- **[Pressure band narrative, direction]** ([high/med/low categorical band], [supportive ðŸŒž/restrictive ðŸŒ‘/mixed ðŸŒ—])
- **[Support cut/holding/prevailing]** ([scaffolding present/challenged/absent])
- **[Depleted/resilient/rebounding]** ([reserves and recovery narrative])

### Climate Line
**[How typological baseline responds to current transits â€” constitutional weather dance]**

---

## **Vector-Integrity Check**
*Mandatory labels for structurally qualified but behaviorally quiet drivers:*
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]**: **[Vector name from corpus]** - **[structural presence but contained/waiting]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]**: **[Vector name]** - **[boundaries fortified/compensated by earth placements]**
- **[Latent/Suppressed/Dormant]**: **[Vector name]** - **[waiting for Saturn return/specific activation]**

---

## **Relational Calibration Gate** 
*(Required for Relational Mirrors)*

Before any Aâ†’B work:
1. **Consent/Scope Statement**: Confirm both parties consent to relational analysis
2. **DRM Orientation**: We're stress-testing rapport dynamics, not pronouncing fate
3. **Referral Boundary**: Extreme severity (10) requires professional support recommendation

Select tier (Partner/Family/Friend/Acquaintance) and render bidirectional paragraphs.

## **Polarity Cards** (FIELD â†’ MAP â†’ VOICE)

### 1) **[Polarity Name A]** â†” **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Somatic/sensory texture of this tension]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: planets, aspect, sign/house placement]  
**VOICE**: **[Conditional behavioral description using may/might/could with both poles]**

### 2) **[Polarity Name A]** â†” **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Embodied feel or pressure description]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: symbolic geometry source]  
**VOICE**: **[Plain-language explanation showing both sides]**

### 3) **[Polarity Name A]** â†” **[Polarity Name B]**
**FIELD**: **[Felt tone or sensory image]**  
**MAP**: [Operator only: exact geometric source]  
**VOICE**: **[Everyday description of how tension may surface]**

---

## **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**[How constitutional climate (builder vs tide-puller) responds to current geometric weather]**

**[Whether support structures hold or friction cuts through them â€” SFD narrative integration]**

**[Reframe structural tension as engine/feature, not flaw â€” dialogue creates movement]**

**[Closing invitation for both sides to speak rather than choosing one]**

---

## **Agency + Hygiene**

If this doesn't land, it doesn't count (OSR valid).

All phrasing remains conditional (may/might/could).

The SST classification depends entirely on your lived experience confirmation.

---

## **FIELD â†’ MAP â†’ VOICE Protocol Note**
VOICE never outruns MAP. Metaphor stays leashed to actual geometry to maintain audit trail.

## **EDP Switch**
When input arrives emotionally charged, feeling-tone is stripped during diagnosis, then restored in VOICE to avoid false resonance while speaking to lived experience.

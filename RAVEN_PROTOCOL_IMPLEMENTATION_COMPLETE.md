# Raven Calder Narrative Protocol — Implementation Complete
**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ALL FOUR PHASES IMPLEMENTED  
**Effort**: ~12-18 hours of development completed

---

## Executive Summary

All four critical narrative gaps have been **implemented and integrated**. The system now delivers the full Raven Calder experience: warm, specific, grounded, and falsifiable.

**What Changed**: The infrastructure was solid. We added the narrative layer that converts data into conversational mirrors.

---

## Phase 1: Frontstage Preface ✅ COMPLETE

**File**: `src/formatter/frontstage-preface.js`

**What It Does**:
- Extracts blueprint modes (Sun, Moon, ASC) from natal chart
- Generates warm, coffee-shop persona intro
- Creates 3-4 paragraph resonance profile
- Identifies 1-3 productive paradoxes
- For relational: names both parties explicitly

**Key Functions**:
- `generateFrontstagePreface()` — Main entry point
- `extractBlueprintModes()` — Identifies primary/secondary/shadow modes
- `generatePersonaIntro()` — Raven's warm greeting
- `generateResonanceProfile()` — 3-4 paragraph synthesis
- `extractParadoxes()` — Productive tensions from chart

**Integration**: Automatically called at start of `createMarkdownReadingEnhanced()`

**Example Output**:
```
# Woven Mirror: Dan & Stephie

## Frontstage Preface

I'm Raven. I read charts like maps—not predictions, but mirrors. 
Let me show you what I see in Dan's geometry.

### Your Baseline Pattern

Dan comes across as purposeful and curious, someone who's always 
looking at the bigger picture but never rushing blindly. People 
sense that Dan is steady, yet inside there's often a back-and-forth 
between the part that wants to move and the part that waits until 
the ground feels solid.

### The Productive Tensions

- The tension between wanting to shine and doubting whether you should.
- The dance between holding on and letting go.
```

---

## Phase 2: Solo Mirror Template ✅ COMPLETE

**File**: `src/formatter/solo-mirror-template.js`

**What It Does**:
- Generates Hook Stack (two polarity titles)
- Creates Polarity Cards (3-4 defining tensions)
- Stitches Mirror Voice (gathered reflection)
- Never asks user for format preferences—just executes

**Key Functions**:
- `generateSoloMirror()` — Main entry point
- `generateHookStack()` — Two polarity titles with descriptions
- `generatePolarityCards()` — 3-4 defining polarities (both sides)
- `generateMirrorVoice()` — Stitched reflection

**Integration**: Called for each person in relational reports

**Example Output**:
```
## Solo Mirror: Dan

### The Spark / The Anchor

**The Spark**: The part that ignites, that wants to move fast 
and see what happens

**The Anchor**: The part that questions, that wants to make sure 
the ground is solid

### The Defining Tensions

#### Action vs. Reflection

**Active**: When you move, you move decisively. There's an impulse 
to act, to test, to see what happens.

**Reflective**: But there's also a part that pauses, that wants to 
think it through, that worries about consequences.

**Both**: This isn't indecision—it's the tension between two valid 
ways of knowing. Sometimes you need to move first; sometimes you 
need to think first. The trick is knowing which moment calls for which.

### Your Mirror

Here's what I see in your chart: You're not one thing. You're a 
system of tensions, and that's where your power lives.

The tension between action vs. reflection is real and productive. 
This isn't indecision—it's the tension between two valid ways of 
knowing. Sometimes you need to move first; sometimes you need to 
think first. The trick is knowing which moment calls for which.

These aren't contradictions to resolve. They're the actual shape of 
how you're built...
```

## Phase 3: Relational Flow with Directional Attribution ✅ COMPLETE

**File**: `src/formatter/relational-flow.js`

**What It Does**:
- Step 1: Individual diagnostics (Solo Mirror for each person)
- Step 2: Parallel weather (each person's transits)
- Step 3: Conditional layer (When PersonA does X, PersonB responds with Y)
- Step 4: Integration (blending climates)
- Step 5: Balance Meter (magnitude and directional bias at end)

**Attribution Mandate**: Always names who experiences what. Never uses generic pronouns.

**Key Functions**:
- `generateRelationalFlow()` — Main orchestrator
- `generateIndividualDiagnostics()` — Solo mirrors for both
- `generateParallelWeather()` — Each person's transits
- `generateConditionalLayer()` — Specific names, directional attribution
- `generateIntegration()` — Shared climate narrative
- `generateBalanceMeterSummary()` — Magnitude + Directional Bias

**Integration**: Automatically called when two people present

**Example Output**:
```
## The Relational Engine

### How You Two Move Together

Dan is carrying more of the pressure right now. When Dan experiences 
this intensity, Stephie often responds by moving toward, opening up, 
engaging.

### The Pattern

The dominant theme between you is: **Spark Engine**

The relational tension shows up as: Dan's expansive energy meets 
Stephie's need for stability

The relational flow is: Amplification and grounding

### Who Experiences What

- **Dan**: Magnitude 3.8, Direction expansive
- **Stephie**: Magnitude 2.4, Direction contractive

## Integration: The Shared Climate

Together, Dan and Stephie create a particular atmosphere. The dominant 
theme right now is: **Spark Engine**

This isn't something Dan is doing to Stephie, or vice versa. It's the 
field that emerges when you're in the same room...

## Overall Symbolic Weather

**Magnitude**: 3.1 (noticeable motifs)
How loud the symbolic field is right now.

**Directional Bias**: 0.8 (slightly expansive)
Which way the energy is leaning—toward expansion or contraction.
```

## Phase 4: Aspect Mandate ✅ COMPLETE

**File**: `src/formatter/aspect-mandate.js`

**What It Does**:
- Translates Geometry → Archetype → Lived Tension
- Uses Advanced Diagnostic Lexicon (Current, Hook, Compression, Paradox Lock)
- Generates FIELD pressure, MAP translation, VOICE mirror
- Frames as possible patterns, not facts

**Template**:
```
[geometry] creates a wire between [archetype A] and [archetype B].

Field pressure: [FIELD description]
Map translation: [behavioral pattern]
Voice mirror: "This often shows up as..."
```

**Key Functions**:
- `translateAspectToVoice()` — Main translation engine
- `getPlanetArchetype()` — Maps planets to archetypal meanings
- `determineDiagnosticLexicon()` — Current/Hook/Compression/Paradox Lock
- `generateFieldPressure()` — Raw intensity description
- `generateMapTranslation()` — Behavioral pattern
- `generateVoiceMirror()` — Lived experience translation
- `generateAspectMandateSection()` — Full aspect section for chart

**Integration**: Called for each person's chart

**Example Output**:
```
## Dan's Aspect Geometry

### 1. Sun opposition Saturn (orb: 0.8°) [Paradox Lock]

This creates a wire between Core Identity (who you are at your center) 
and Structure & Limits (what you build and fear).

**Field pressure**: Energy pulls in opposite directions—but the 
contradiction is built in. This isn't a problem to solve; it's a 
paradox to live with.

**Map translation**: Your core identity wants to shine; Saturn wants 
to contain. The tension is productive.

**Voice mirror**: "This often shows up as: Your core identity wants 
to shine; Saturn wants to contain. The tension is productive."

---

### 2. Moon square Mars (orb: 2.1°) [Current]

This creates a wire between Emotional Nature (how you feel and respond) 
and Will & Action (how you move and assert).

**Field pressure**: Energy creates friction and urgency. This is 
active, present energy.

**Map translation**: Your emotions and your will create friction. 
You're learning to channel both.

**Voice mirror**: "This often shows up as: Your emotions and your 
will create friction. You're learning to channel both."
```

## Philosophy

**Before**: Infrastructure was solid but data-heavy. Reports output raw geometry.

**After**: Same solid infrastructure + narrative layer that converts data into lived experience.

**Result**: Users get warm, specific, grounded mirrors that feel personal and actionable.

**Raven Calder's Voice**: "I read charts as mirrors—not predictions, but geometry translated into the actual way you tend to move through the world."

# 🌟 Woven Map v6 Architecture: Complete Templates, Schema, and Evolution

This document provides four integrated deliverables:
1. **Polished Woven Map v6 Solo Mirror Template** — Production-ready
2. **Matching Relational Mirror Template** — Synchronized architecture
3. **Comprehensive JSON Schema** — Both report types + provenance
4. **Migration Guide** — Mapping historical eras into v6 structure

---

# A) WOVEN MAP v6 SOLO MIRROR TEMPLATE (Depersonalized, Production-Ready)

## Format Overview

The Solo Mirror is a **modular, dual-language report** separating **frontstage (interpretation)** from **backstage (geometry & provenance)**. It is output as **markdown text**, with optional JSON backstage export for system integration.

---

## FRONTSTAGE: Solo Mirror Narrative

### 0. Resonant Summary (Entry Point)

*3–4 paragraphs blending Behavioral Anchors, Conditional Impulses, Core Pressure Patterns, and Polarity Snapshot into a cohesive narrative. Tone: conversational, grounded, testable.*

---

#### Para 1 — Core Impression

Begin with a single sentence capturing the primary constellation (Sun/Ascendant/Saturn archetype). Follow with a observation about the internal rhythm or baseline stance.

**Example template:**
> You come across as [primary mode + secondary orientation], someone who [observable behavioral pattern]. People sense [external perception], yet inside [internal reality or tension].

---

#### Para 2 — The Rotation of Drives

Name 3–4 distinct internal "voices" (derived from the chart's major polarities: Sun/Moon, Mars/Saturn, Venus/Pluto, etc.). Show how they trade places and why this creates both adaptability and internal negotiation.

**Example template:**
> Underneath, you've got [3–4 distinct drives: the dreamer, the builder, the disruptor, etc.] trading places. At different times one takes the lead, but all are always in the mix. This is why you can [positive outcome], but also why you sometimes [the internal friction or paradox].

---

#### Para 3 — The Pressure Patterns

Name 2–3 core tensions revealed by hard aspects, Saturn placements, or unresolved polarities. Frame these as *patterns, not flaws*—they're the chart's way of building resilience.

**Example template:**
> This inner system brings both gifts and friction. Sometimes you [Pattern A: what gets held back], sometimes you [Pattern B: what scatters or erupts], and often [Pattern C: the replay loop or self-review]. These aren't flaws — they're the way your chart has taught you resilience.

---

#### Para 4 — The Big Picture

Synthesize into one integrative statement. Show what living with this constellation *means practically*.

**Example template:**
> What this all adds up to is a life spent balancing [core polarity]. You're not one-dimensional — you rotate between [the distinct modes]. And people who know you well feel that [the overall texture]: not [potential negative stereotype], but [the authentic depth].

---

### 1. Personality Mirror — Natal Blueprint (Detailed Breakdown)

Expand the Resonant Summary into its component layers. Use subheadings and bullet points for clarity.

---

#### A. Behavioral Anchors

*What shows up immediately, visibly, testably.*

- **Primary Archetype** [Sun/Ascendant reference]: "The way you tend to lead, present, or approach new situations."
- **Secondary Scaffold** [Moon/Venus reference]: "The emotional or relational undergirding; what you need to feel stable."
- **Shadow Anchor** [Saturn/Hard Aspect]: "The area where you're most aware of resistance, limitation, or old patterns."

**Falsifiable statement format:**
> When [circumstance], you tend to [observable behavior], because [geometric reason: e.g., 'Mars in your 8th square Moon']

---

#### B. Conditional Impulses

*What activates under stress, opportunity, or specific emotional contexts.*

- **Under Pressure** [Hard aspect or Saturn]: "Your first move is typically [defensive/offensive/analytical/relational]."
- **In Opportunity** [Benefic aspect or Jupiter]: "You reach for [growth, leadership, connection, etc.]."
- **In Doubt** [Saturn/12th house/Neptune]: "You tend to [replay, withdraw, intellectualize, seek reassurance]."

---

#### C. Core Pressure Patterns

*The persistent tensions your chart generates—not problems, but structural patterns.*

- **Pattern 1**: [Polarity name] — Sun-Moon, Mars-Saturn, Venus-Pluto, etc.
  - How it manifests: "You oscillate between [one drive] and [another drive]."
  - Why it matters: "This creates [adaptability + internal negotiation]."
  
- **Pattern 2**: [Secondary tension]
  - Mechanism: [Aspect + houses]
  - Lived experience: [Observable outcome]

---

#### D. Polarity Snapshot

*Concise pairings of the chart's defining tensions. Format: [Name A / Name B] with planetary/house grounding.*

| Polarity | Left Pole | Right Pole | Grounded In | Integration |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Agency ↔ Circumspection** | Mars trine Ascendant | Saturn square Mercury | You move decisively AND carefully test ground before committing. |
| **Expression ↔ Reserve** | Sun in 10th | Moon conjunct 12th | You're visible publicly AND you protect your inner world. |
| **Connection ↔ Autonomy** | Venus in 7th | Saturn aspect | You seek partnership AND you need your independence uncompromised. |

---

#### What This Is Actually Saying (Plain Language)

*A single paragraph translating the geometry into lived implication.*

> Your chart doesn't push you toward a single way of being. Instead, it sets up a rhythm where you naturally move between [the polarities]. This isn't indecision — it's responsiveness. The tension itself is the pattern. And when you allow both sides to speak without choosing one as "good" and the other as "flaw," the chart becomes generative rather than restrictive.

---

### 2. Symbolic Weather (Transits & Activations)

*Only included if transits are present in the report request.*

---

#### Overview: What's Stirring Now

*One paragraph describing the *texture* of the current transit period — magnitude, valence, volatility in human terms.*

**Template:**
> The next [time period] carries a [atmospheric quality: compressed, expansive, volatile, etc.] quality. Key transits are [brief list: e.g., Mercury sextile natal Mars, Venus square Saturn], which tend to light up [your chart area: relationships, work, inner psychology, etc.]. The overall climate is [descriptive: supported, under tension, clarifying, etc.].

---

#### Daily Climate Readings

*If Balance Meter daily data is available, present it as a narrative with optional table.*

**Narrative approach:**
> On [date], [transit description] is exact, bringing a spike in [quality: clarity, friction, etc.]. Your [chart-sensitive area] will likely feel [the lived translation]. By mid-week, [next major aspect] adds a [secondary quality].

**Optional table:**
| Date | Aspect | Magnitude | Quality | Falsifiability Note |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 2025-12-01 | Mercury △ natal Mars | High | Supported clarity | Ideas flow; communication lands. |
| 2025-12-04 | Venus □ natal Saturn | Moderate | Constraint in relating | Emotional boundaries tighten; deeper conversations needed. |
| 2025-12-08 | Sun ◊ natal Jupiter | High | Openness | Optimism, momentum, visibility. |

---

#### FIELD → MAP → VOICE Integration

*Translate the transits through the Raven Calder protocol.*

- **FIELD**: Neutral description of the atmospheric condition (magnitude, volatility, directional bias).
- **MAP**: Structural meaning in your natal chart (where does this activate? what resonates?).
- **VOICE**: Lived possibility. What might this feel like? What could you do with it?

**Example full line:**
> **FIELD:** Transit Mercury sextile natal Mars (magnitude 6.2, supported). **MAP:** This lights up your communication + action channels, especially around decisions you've been circling. **VOICE:** Expect clarity. Conversations that have felt blocked may suddenly flow. If you're testing a move, the air is less resistant now. Falsifiable check: does speaking your mind feel more direct this week?

---

### 3. Closing Loop: Invitation for Resonance

*Plain-language invitation for the user to verify and refine the mirror.*

> Here's your personality mirror (the permanent landscape) and today's weather (the temporary activation). What landed most? What felt like a miss? Mirror language aims to describe probability, not certainty. If something resonates, make note of it. If something doesn't, the geometry may need reframing based on better birth data.

---

### 4. Provenance & Falsifiability (Backstage Visible)

*Transparency about how the report was built and what was not or could not be included.*

**Required fields:**
- **Subject Name/ID:** [anonymized or explicit]
- **Birth Data:** Date, time (precision), location (precision)
- **Chart Source:** [API, self-report, registry]
- **House System:** [Placidus/Equal/Whole Sign]
- **Orbs Profile:** [wm-spec-2025-11, or standard]
- **Ephemeris:** [AstrologerAPI v4, or other]
- **Relocation Mode:** [Birthplace/A_local/B_local/etc, if applicable]
- **Transits Included:** [Yes/No; if yes, date range]

# B) WOVEN MAP v6 RELATIONAL MIRROR TEMPLATE (Synchronized Architecture)

## Format Overview

The Relational Mirror extends the Solo template to two people, adding **synastry dynamics (relational engines)** between the two natal charts while preserving individual clarity. Structure: **frontstage (interpretive) + backstage (dual geometry + provenance)**.

---

## FRONTSTAGE: Relational Mirror Narrative

### 0. Relational Summary (Entry Point)

*4–5 paragraphs blending both individuals' blueprints and their interactive pattern.*

---

#### Para 1 — Dual Impression

Name both people (or anonymized IDs). Describe their individual baseline tones in a single sentence each. Then, in one line, the *quality of their intersection*.

**Example template:**
> Person A comes across as [primary mode], someone who [baseline]. Person B presents as [primary mode], someone who [baseline]. Together, they create a [relational quality: a spark, a steady rhythm, a productive tension, etc.].

---

#### Para 2 — Person A's Baseline

*Distilled from their solo mirror: core drives, internal rhythm, what they bring.*

---

#### Para 3 — Person B's Baseline

*Same as Para 2, for Person B.*

---

#### Para 4 — The Relational System

*How the two systems interact. Name the main synastry engines.*

> The core dynamic between them runs through [Engine 1], [Engine 2], and [Engine 3]. These three patterns create a [overall texture: a cooperative flow, productive friction, cyclical tension, etc.].

---

#### Para 5 — Integration Note

> What makes this dynamic workable (or challenging) is that [both people's strengths or compensatory patterns]. When they [specific relational behavior], the pattern [resolves/escalates/clarifies]. Falsifiable check: does this match your lived experience?

---

### 1. Individual Foundations

---

#### Solo Mirror: Person A

*Full Solo Mirror template (see Section A above) for Person A.*

---

#### Solo Mirror: Person B

*Full Solo Mirror template for Person B.*

---

### 2. Relational Engines — Synastry Dynamics

*Named interaction patterns between the two charts.*

---

#### Structure: Engine Cards

**For each engine:**

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Engine Name** | Concise, memorable title (e.g., "Spark Engine", "Steady Pulse", "Friction Forge") |
| **Geometry** | Exact synastry aspects (e.g., "Person A's Mars trine Person B's Venus, 1.2° orb") |
| **Mechanism** | What the geometry creates mechanically (e.g., "Dynamic, supportive flow between action + desire") |
| **Tendency** | How it shows up behaviorally (e.g., "Person A's initiative lands smoothly; Person B feels naturally supported.") |
| **Falsifiability** | Observable test (e.g., "Does Person A's energy feel galvanizing to Person B?") |
| **Tone** | Supported / Neutral / Challenging |

---

#### Examples

---

**Engine 1: Spark Engine**

| Aspect | Person A Mars | trine | Person B Venus |
|--------|---------------|-------|---|
| **Orb** | 1.2° | — | — |
| **Mechanism** | Mars (action, desire, initiative) meets Venus (attraction, pleasure, relational ease) harmoniously. No friction; natural flow. |
| **Tendency** | Person A's moves land well; Person B naturally wants to engage. There's an ease here — conversations start, projects align, physical ease is present. When Person A proposes, Person B doesn't resist automatically. |
| **Falsifiability** | Do you feel that when Person A steps forward, there's less pushback from Person B? Does the dynamic feel supportive rather than reactive? |
| **Tone** | Supported |

---

**Engine 2: Steady Pulse**

| Aspect | Person A Sun | sextile | Person B Saturn |
|--------|------------|---------|---|
| **Orb** | 2.1° | — | — |
| **Mechanism** | Sun (core identity, life direction) meets Saturn (structure, time, discipline) in a beneficial angle. Saturn supports and consolidates Sun's vision. |
| **Tendency** | Person B's realism balances Person A's optimism. When Person A dreams, Person B asks: "How? When? What's the timeline?" This is steadying, not deflating. Long-term plans actually *happen* because of this dynamic. |
| **Falsifiability** | Does Person B's input make Person A's ideas more real and actionable rather than less appealing? |
| **Tone** | Supported |

---

**Engine 3: Friction Forge**

| Aspect | Person A Moon | square | Person B Pluto |
|--------|-------------|--------|---|
| **Orb** | 2.8° | — | — |
| **Mechanism** | Moon (emotional need, security, past) meets Pluto (transformation, intensity, shadow). Square = tension, not harmony. |
| **Tendency** | Person B's intensity can feel destabilizing to Person A's emotional world. Person A seeks comfort; Person B brings upheaval. But this same pressure can force growth—Person A becomes less defensive, Person B learns to soften. |
| **Falsifiability** | Do emotional conversations between them tend to go deep fast? Does Person A sometimes feel emotionally overwhelmed or changed by Person B? |
| **Tone** | Challenging (generative) |

---

### 3. Relational Resonance Modes

*How the relationship *tends to move* under different conditions.*

---

#### Mode 1: Aligned (When Both Feel Supported)

*Describe what the relationship looks like when synastry's supportive aspects dominate.*

> When both are grounded, the dynamic is [description]. They tend to [cooperative behavior]. The rhythm is [natural, efficient, playful, etc.].

---

#### Mode 2: Friction (When Challenging Aspects Activate)

*Describe the pattern when hard aspects come forward.*

> Under stress, Person A tends to [response], and Person B tends to [response]. The tension often centers on [core conflict: needs vs. intensity, autonomy vs. togetherness, etc.]. When managed well, this friction [generative outcome]. When unaddressed, it [problematic pattern].

---

#### Mode 3: Integration (The Workable Rhythm)

*Describe the sustainable rhythm that acknowledges both.*

> Over time, the two systems can learn to [integration move]. Person A provides [Person A's gift], Person B provides [Person B's gift]. Together, they create [emergent third quality].

---

### 4. Symbolic Weather (Transits Activating the Relational Field)

*Only included if transits are in the request and affect both people or their interaction.*

---

#### Dual Transit Context

*How current transits affect each person's natal chart and their synastry pattern.*

**Template:**
> For the next [period], transits are illuminating [the relational channel]. Specifically:
> - Person A is experiencing [transit effect] on [natal point], which tends to [their response].
> - Person B is experiencing [transit effect] on [natal point], which tends to [their response].
> - *Between them*, this may activate the [synastry engine], bringing [relational quality: increased friction, deeper connection, etc.].

---

#### Timeline of Likely Relational Moments

| Date | Person A Transit | Person B Transit | Synastry Implication | Lived Probability |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 2025-12-01 | Mercury △ Mars | Venus △ Venus | Spark Engine amplified | Smooth communication, shared desire |
| 2025-12-05 | — | Mars □ Saturn | Person B feels constrained | May withdraw or test boundaries |
| 2025-12-10 | Sun ◊ Jupiter | Venus △ Jupiter | Both expansive; mutual optimism | Shared plans, generosity, alignment |

---

### 5. Closing Loop: Relational Resonance Check

> Here are the two baselines and the three core engines that run between them. What lands? Which engine feels most active in your lived experience? Which one surprises you? And when things get tense, does it match the "Friction Forge" pattern described? Mirror language invites verification and refinement. Use what resonates; bracket what doesn't.

---

# D) MIGRATION GUIDE: Era → v6 Structure

## How Historical Eras Map into Woven Map v6

---

## ERA 1: Diagnostic Narrative (Early Phase)

**Characteristics:**
- Narrative diagnostics, minimal structure
- Reflective/probing questions
- Psychodynamic vocabulary

**Mapping to v6:**
- ✅ Content becomes **Resonant Summary** (Paras 1–4)
- ✅ Probing questions → **Closing Loop** (invitation for verification)
- ✅ Core tensions → **Polarity Snapshot** section
- ❌ Removed: Explicitly psychoanalytic framing (v6 uses "test" instead of "interpret")

**Migration Path:**
```
OLD: "Your chart reflects an oscillation between autonomy and merger."
NEW: "You rotate between independence and connection. When you allow both, the pattern becomes generative."
```

---

## ERA 2: Poetic Geometry (Rich Prose Phase)

**Characteristics:**
- Highly expressive, evocative prose
- Symbolic footnotes behind narrative
- Minimal modularity
- High density

**Mapping to v6:**
- ✅ Rich prose preserved in **Symbolic Weather** section (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)
- ✅ Symbolic footnotes → **Backstage data tables** (Developer Audit Layer)
- ✅ Dual-language pattern → **Frontstage/Backstage separation**
- ❌ Removed: Prose density (v6 prioritizes clarity + testability)

**Migration Path:**
```
OLD: "You carry the weight of structure and the lightness of desire."
NEW: "Saturn (weight, time) and Venus (ease, pleasure) create an oscillation. You're building toward something, and you also need to enjoy the present."
```

---

## ERA 3: Prototype Era (Clear Mirror Structure)

**Characteristics:**
- Consistent sections (Preface, Frontstage, Symbolic Footnotes, Core Insights, Polarity Cards, Integration, Mirror Voice, Socratic Closure)
- Clean alternation between narrative and geometry
- Highly readable

**Mapping to v6:**
- ✅ Preface → **Resonant Summary** (paras 0)
- ✅ Frontstage → **Personality Mirror** sections (A–D)
- ✅ Polarity Cards → **Polarity Snapshot** (exact match)
- ✅ Mirror Voice → **Integration note** + **Closing Loop**
- ✅ Socratic Closure → **Falsifiability notes** in Closing Loop
- ✅ Symbolic Footnotes → **Backstage: Data Tables**

**Migration Path:**
```
No major conceptual migration needed; v6 formalizes Prototype structure.
```

---

## ERA 4: Refinement Era (Modular Minimalism)

**Characteristics:**
- Sparse, schematic modules
- Emotionally neutral, efficient
- System-friendly but too terse

**Mapping to v6:**
- ✅ Module structure preserved
- ✅ System-friendliness → **JSON Schema** (structure aligned)
- ❌ Removed: Emotional flatness (v6 restores voice + depth)
- ✅ Efficiency → **Polarity Cards** (compressed, scannable format)

**Migration Path:**
```
OLD (minimalist): "Mars □ Moon: reactive impulse. Saturn ⊗ Venus: constraint in relating."
NEW (v6): Same as OLD, but wrapped in Personality Mirror narrative that explains WHY this pattern exists and what it means lived.
```

---

## ERA 5 → v6: Integration (Current, Formalized)

**What v6 adds to the Evolution:**

1. **Explicit Frontstage/Backstage Separation**
   - Frontstage: Narrative, emotional resonance, testability
   - Backstage: All raw geometry, tables, provenance

2. **Mandatory Falsifiability**
   - Every claim in the narrative maps to geometry OR explicitly marked "outside symbolic range"
   - Closing Loop invites user verification

3. **Structured Polarity Cards**
   - Consistent format across all reports
   - Clear integration statement for each polarity

4. **Persona Excerpt Integration**
   - Corpus-derived tone automatically included in provenance
   - Visible in all exported formats

5. **Relational Architecture**
   - Named Synastry Engines (Spark, Steady Pulse, Friction Forge, etc.)
   - Dual Solo Mirrors + Synastry layering
   - Resonance Modes (Aligned, Friction, Integration)

6. **JSON Schema Formalization**
   - All narrative output also available as typed JSON
   - Enables programmatic report generation and export
   - Consistent with Math Brain backend

---

## Concrete Migration Examples

---

### Example 1: Diagnostic Narrative → Solo Mirror

**ERA 1 (Diagnostic Narrative)**
```
"You are marked by an inner debate. The external you is methodical and clear. 
The internal you harbors dreams and restlessness. People don't see the second part 
unless you trust them. This creates a rhythm of holding back and then suddenly revealing."
```

**ERA 3 (Clear Mirror Structure)**
```
Preface: [metadata]
Frontstage Narrative:
- Para 1: "You come across as methodical and clear..."
- Core Tensions: [list of aspects + houses]
- Polarity Card: "Clarity ↔ Dreams" (Saturn ⊗ Neptune)
- Mirror Voice: "The tension itself is the pattern..."
Socratic Closure: "What landed?"
```

**v6 (Integration)**
```
Frontstage:
  Resonant Summary (Para 1–4): Full narrative weaving methodology, dreams, trust, holding/revealing
  Personality Mirror:
    A. Behavioral Anchors: Primary (Saturn), Secondary (Neptune), Shadow
    B. Conditional Impulses: Under pressure, In opportunity, In doubt
    C. Core Pressure Patterns: "Methodical ↔ Dreamful" (named)
    D. Polarity Snapshot: Table format, grounded geometry

Backstage:
  Data Tables: All aspects, houses, retrogrades
  Provenance: Source, precision, confidence flags
```

---

### Example 2: Poetic Geometry → Symbolic Weather

**ERA 2 (Poetic)**
```
"The current moment holds both expansion and constraint. 
Jupiter's whisper meets Saturn's boundary. You feel pulled between growth and caution."
```

**ERA 4 (Minimalist)**
```
Transit: Jupiter □ Saturn, 1.2°
Magnitude: 6.8
Tendency: Expansion meets caution
```

**v6 (Integrated)**
```
Symbolic Weather Section:
  FIELD: "The next 3 weeks carry a compressed-expansion quality. Multiple fronts stacking."
  MAP: "Jupiter sextile your natal Sun (expansion, visibility), but Saturn square your natal Venus (constraint in relating)."
  VOICE: "Expect ideas to flow and feel ripe, but emotional negotiations to feel tighter. Test new ground; manage expectations in close relationships. Falsifiable check: does communication feel clear but relating feel cautious?"
```

---

### Example 3: Relational (No Historical Equivalent → New in v6)

**v6 Relational (New)**
```
Individual Foundations:
  Solo Mirror A: [Full v6 structure for Person A]
  Solo Mirror B: [Full v6 structure for Person B]

Relational Engines:
  - Spark Engine: Person A Mars △ Person B Venus → dynamic flow
  - Steady Pulse: Person A Sun ♅ Person B Saturn → long-term stability
  - Friction Forge: Person A Moon □ Person B Pluto → growth through tension

Resonance Modes:
  - Aligned: What it looks like when supportive aspects lead
  - Friction: What happens when hard aspects activate
  - Integration: The sustainable rhythm

Synastry Aspects Table: [Full geometric breakdown]
Composite Chart: [Optional, if requested]
```

---

## Migration Checklist: Converting Old Reports to v6

**If you have legacy reports and want to align them with v6:**

1. ✅ Extract narrative prose → fit into **Resonant Summary** structure (Paras 1–4)
2. ✅ Extract core tensions → create **Polarity Snapshot** table
3. ✅ Extract any geometric data → populate **Backstage: Data Tables**
4. ✅ Add explicit **Falsifiability notes** for each claim
5. ✅ Separate narrative from geometry into **Frontstage/Backstage**
6. ✅ If relational: Extract synastry patterns → name as **Relational Engines**
7. ✅ Add **Provenance block** with source, precision, confidence
8. ✅ Generate matching **JSON export** using schema in Section C
9. ✅ Add **Closing Loop** invitation for user verification

---

## Version Compatibility

- **v6 → Earlier eras:** All v6 reports *contain* sufficient data to downgrade to earlier formats
- **Earlier eras → v6:** Not all legacy data maps cleanly; may require manual reframing or removal of psychoanalytic language
- **JSON ↔ Markdown:** v6 schema supports round-trip export (markdown narrative + JSON data, both complete)

---

---

# Summary

This document provides:

1. **A) Polished Woven Map v6 Solo Mirror Template** — Production-ready, with frontstage narrative (Resonant Summary → Personality Mirror → Symbolic Weather → Closing Loop) and backstage data (tables, provenance, audit layer).

2. **B) Matching Relational Mirror Template** — Dual solo foundations + synastry engines (named, mechanistic, tendentious) + resonance modes + relational closing.

3. **C) Comprehensive JSON Schema** — TypeScript-style type definitions for Solo and Relational reports, enabling programmatic generation, export, and integration with Math Brain / Poetic Brain backend.

4. **D) Migration Guide** — Maps 5 historical eras (Diagnostic → Poetic → Prototype → Refinement → v6) showing how each evolved and how to convert legacy reports into v6 structure.

**Use Cases:**

- **Report Generation:** Use templates A & B as the narrative structure; populate with Math Brain geometry + Poetic Brain voice.
- **System Integration:** Use schema C to validate and serialize reports in JSON; ensures consistency across exporters (PDF, JSON, AIPacket).
- **Legacy Migration:** Use guide D to convert old reports or explain v6 structure to systems currently operating on earlier formats.
- **Corpus Integration:** Persona excerpt (Raven Calder) is now formally stamped in provenance; all reports include it in their source attribution.

# [Subject Name] — Clear Mirror Reading
*Woven Map | Reader + Reflection Format*

---

### Preface
*(Context-setting for the reading. Explains any necessary choices made, like chart rectification, and defines core concepts like the Ascendant vs. Sun sign. This section establishes the reader's methodology and transparency.)*

---

### Frontstage
*(The main, narrative portion of the reading. It translates the geometric patterns into observable human tendencies and experiences. It should be written in a poetic, non-deterministic voice, offering hypotheses to be tested by the subject.)*

---

### Symbolic Footnotes
*(Direct, traceable links between the "Frontstage" narrative and the specific astrological geometry. Each footnote connects a behavioral observation back to its source aspect or placement, making the reading falsifiable and transparent.)*

*   ¹ [Symbolic justification for the first Frontstage point.]
*   ² [Symbolic justification for the second Frontstage point.]
*   ³ [Symbolic justification for the third Frontstage point.]
*   ⁴ [Symbolic justification for the fourth Frontstage point.]
*   ⁵ [Symbolic justification for the fifth Frontstage point.]

---

### Resonant Summary
*(A concise synthesis of the core themes. This section distills the most important dynamics of the chart into a few key paragraphs, focusing on learning, relationships, and personal refinement over time.)*

---

### Core Insights
*(Bulleted, thematic takeaways. Each insight is given a evocative title and explains a key mechanism or pattern in the chart, like "The Architect of Motion" or "The Honest Mirror.")*

*   **[Insight Title 1]**
    *   [Explanation of the core dynamic.]
*   **[Insight Title 2]**
    *   [Explanation of the core dynamic.]
*   **[Insight Title 3]**
    *   [Explanation of the core dynamic.]

---

### Personality Blueprint
*(A summary of the subject's core operational logic. It describes how they tend to function under pressure, what stabilizes them, and what they need to feel balanced and alive. It's a practical summary of the chart's main drivers.)*

---

### Polarity Cards
*(A series of short, paradoxical, or complementary concepts for reflection. These act as koans or focusing lenses, presenting core tensions in the chart as dynamics to be observed, not problems to be solved.)*

*   **[Polarity 1]** vs. **[Polarity 2]**
*   **[Polarity 3]** vs. **[Polarity 4]**
*   **[Polarity 5]** vs. **[Polarity 6]**

---

### Integration
*(A concluding paragraph that offers a path forward. It reframes the chart's challenges as intelligent rhythms and provides a final, empowering perspective on how to work with the revealed patterns.)*

---

### Inner Constitution
*(A description of the primary internal "voices" or drives. It personifies the core tensions and collaborations within the subject's psyche, framing them as an internal dialogue.)*

---

### Mirror Voice
*(A final, one-paragraph distillation of the reading's central message. This is the "so what" of the entire reflection, the single most important takeaway for the present moment.)*

---

### Socratic Closure
*(An interactive closing that empowers the subject to become a co-creator in the reading. It provides a framework for them to calibrate the reading's accuracy against their own lived experience, reinforcing the principle that the map is not the territory.)*

*As you read, mark each idea's resonance:*
*   **WB (Within Boundary):** feels accurate
*   **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** partly fits
*   **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** doesn't fit

*These marks are not judgments but calibrations. Testing creates truth; resonance proves geometry.*

---

### Structure Note
*(A final disclaimer and explanation of the methodology. It reiterates that the reading is a set of hypotheses derived from symbolic geometry, and its truth is only confirmed through the subject's lived experience.)*

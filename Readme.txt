WovenWebAppPure Next.js Edition – November 2025This repository contains the WovenWebApp, a symbolic interpretation and narrative generation engine. This [README.md](https://README.md) is the primary entry point for all developers.The system is built on a "Two Brains" philosophy, which strictly separates deterministic calculation from generative narration.1. The "Two Brains" PhilosophyThe Astro Brain (ASTRO_BRAIN.md)Purpose: The data pipeline. A local, deterministic engine that performs all astrological calculations.Output: Structured, objective JSON (the "ACC Spec v2").The Poetic Brain (POETIC_BRAIN.md)Purpose: The narrative engine. A generative persona ("Raven Calder") that receives the Astro Brain's JSON and writes a subjective, human-readable narrative.Output: Poetic, insightful markdown.2. Canonical DocumentationThis project is governed by a small set of authoritative documents. All other notes, session summaries, and legacy plans are obsolete.High-Level [ConceptsREADME.md](https://ConceptsREADME.md): (This file) The project's "front door."ASTRO_BRAIN.md: The philosophy and components of the data engine.POETIC_BRAIN.md: The persona and protocols of the narrative engine.Implementation & ArchitectureDEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: How to install, run, and test the application.

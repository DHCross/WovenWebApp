# Fix for Google Login Auth0 Issue

## Problem
Getting error "(dev-z8gw1uk6zgsrzubk Oops!, something went wrong)" when trying to log in with Google.

## Root Cause
The Auth0 application is not configured with the correct Client ID and callback URLs.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Get Your Auth0 SPA Application Client ID

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
2. Navigate to **Applications** → **Applications**
3. Find your **Single Page Application** (NOT the Google OAuth app)
4. Copy the **Client ID** from the Settings tab

### 2. Update Environment Configuration

Replace the placeholder in your `.env` file or Netlify environment variables:

```bash
# Replace this placeholder value
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_AUTH0_SPA_CLIENT_ID

# With your actual Auth0 SPA Client ID (should look like this)
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pq
```

### 3. Verify Auth0 Application Settings

In your Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → [Your SPA] → Settings:

#### Application Type
- ✅ Must be: **Single Page Application**

#### Allowed Callback URLs
```
http://localhost:8888
https://your-site.netlify.app
```

#### Allowed Logout URLs
```
http://localhost:8888
https://your-site.netlify.app
```

#### Allowed Web Origins
```
http://localhost:8888
https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### 4. Configure Google Social Connection (Optional)

If you want Google login, configure it as a **Social Connection**:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Social**
2. Click **Create Connection** → **Google**
3. Use your Google OAuth credentials:
   - Client ID: `1084807378002-trcpgg1i56s35qj51tuvrbbi2jo8fcq0.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - Client Secret: `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`
4. Enable it for your SPA application

### 5. What NOT to Do

❌ **DON'T** use these URLs as callback URLs:
- `https://dev-z8gw1uk6zgsrzubk.us.auth0.com/login/callback`
- `http://dev-z8gw1uk6zgsrzubk.us.auth0.com/login/callback`

These are Auth0's **internal** callback URLs where Google sends data to Auth0, not where Auth0 should redirect back to your app.

### 6. Testing

After configuration:

1. Restart your development server
2. The auth buttons should now be enabled
3. Click "Continue with Google" to test the flow
4. You should be redirected to Google, then back to your app

## Changes Made

✅ **Hidden the "Login (Popup)" button** as requested
✅ **Added fallback auth configuration** so the app works without netlify functions
✅ **Improved error messages** to guide proper configuration
✅ **Fixed auth initialization** to handle missing netlify function gracefully

## File Changes

- `index.html`: Added fallback auth config, hidden popup login button, improved error handling
- `.env`: Created with proper structure and placeholder values

The core issue was that the Auth0 Client ID was set to a placeholder value and the app couldn't load configuration when netlify functions weren't available.

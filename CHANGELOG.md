Track every time the app "breaks" (stops working as expected) or is recovered/fixed.  
Each entry should include the date, a brief description, what caused the break (if known), and how it was resolved.

### [2025-08-03 16:50] FIX
**Symptom:**  
The application returned a 404 "Not Found" error when clicking the "Compute Astrological Geometry" button.

**Suspected Cause:**  
The front-end JavaScript in `index.html` was making a `fetch` request directly to the internal Netlify function path (`/.netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain`) instead of using the public-facing API endpoint defined in `netlify.toml`.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Compared the `fetch` URL in `index.html` with the `[[redirects]]` rules in `netlify.toml`. The request was not using the `/api/astrology-mathbrain` path that Netlify was configured to listen for.

**Resolution:**  
Modified the `fetch` call in `index.html` to use the correct endpoint: `/api/astrology-mathbrain`. This allows Netlify to properly handle the request and redirect it to the serverless function, resolving the 404 error.

## Template for Each Entry

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [BREAK/FIX]
**Symptom:**  
(What happened? E.g., "App returned blank report after clicking Generate.")

**Suspected Cause:**  
(What do you think caused it? E.g., "RapidAPI quota exceeded," "Malformed birth coordinates.")

**How Diagnosed:**  
(How did you figure out what was wrong? E.g., "Checked browser console for error message.")

**Resolution:**  
(How did you fix it, or what needs to happen next? E.g., "Added error handling for empty API response.")

## Example Entries

### [2024-06-15 14:22] BREAK
**Symptom:**  
Report Output area remains blank after pressing Generate.

**Suspected Cause:**  
RapidAPI key missing in Netlify environment.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Checked Netlify build logs; saw "Missing RAPIDAPI_KEY" error.

**Resolution:**  
Added RAPIDAPI_KEY to Netlify site settings and redeployed.

---

### [2024-07-02 10:05] BREAK
**Symptom:**  
Error message: "Failed to generate report: End date must be after or equal to start date."

**Suspected Cause:**  
User entered transit end date before start date.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Tested front-end form validation; confirmed logic error in date comparison.

**Resolution:**  
Updated JavaScript validation to prevent this input.

---

### [2024-07-03 09:47] FIX
**Symptom:**  
Previous bug with date validation resolved after code update.

**Suspected Cause:**  
JavaScript form validation logic corrected.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Tested with valid/invalid date ranges; confirmed proper error message and prevention.

**Resolution:**  
App now blocks invalid transit date ranges before sending API request.

---

### [2024-07-10 17:40] BREAK
**Symptom:**  
"Error computing geometry" message appears for all charts.

**Suspected Cause:**  
Astrologer API was down for maintenance.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Checked API provider status page; confirmed outage.

**Resolution:**  
Waited until API service resumed. Added notification about possible external API issues in app UI.

## How to Use

- Every time the app "breaks" or is fixed, add a new entry.
- Be as specific as possible in your descriptions.
- Over time, this log helps you spot repeat issues, patterns, and what fixes worked.

EXAMPLES

[2025-08-03 17:22] UPDATE
- Reviewed workspace for technical debt and improvement areas.
- Noted outdated tailwindcss dependency, missing zod dependency, and lack of TypeScript build configuration.
- Identified unused files (astrology-legacy.txt, Snapshot 7.31.2025), and .env missing for API key management.

[2025-08-03 17:30] FIX
- Updated tailwindcss to latest version (4.1.11) in package.json.
- Installed zod for TypeScript schema validation.
- Created tsconfig.json to enable TypeScript compilation.
- Added 'build:ts' and 'dev' scripts to package.json for easier development workflow.

[2025-08-03 17:32] CHANGE
- Added comprehensive error handling recommendation for Netlify functions (astrology-mathbrain.js).
- Advised creation of local .env file for secure API key management.
- Removed unused file: astrology-legacy.txt.

[2025-08-03 17:34] BREAK
- App failed to run due to missing .env file; RapidAPI requests rejected.
- Symptom: "Error computing geometry" and blank report output.

[2025-08-03 17:35] FIX
- Created .env file using .env.example template.
- Redeployed Netlify functions; API requests now succeed.

[2025-08-03 17:40] RECOMMENDATION
- Consider periodic dependency audits and removal of unused files for long-term health.
- Document all future changes and incidents here to avoid repeating mistakes.

How to use:
- Add a new entry any time you update, fix, break, or change the app.
- Include enough detail for future-you (or collaborators) to understand the cause and solution.
- This history will help you diagnose problems, avoid repeating mistakes, and track improvements over time.

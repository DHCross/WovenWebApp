### [2025-08-06 13:00] CLEANUP: REMOVED JSON BLOCK FROM MARKDOWN REPORT
**Description:**  
Removed the "Raw Geometry Data" JSON block from the Markdown report to align with the app's focus on human-readable output.

**Previous Behavior:**
- Markdown reports included a large JSON block containing raw geometry data
- This was added for transparency/debugging but conflicted with the goal of human-readable output
- JSON block made reports less clean and harder to read

**Changes Made:**
- Removed "Raw Geometry Data" section from Markdown report generation
- Eliminated `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)` output from reports
- Kept the report footer with generation attribution

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with focus on human-readable Markdown output
- Supports Raven Calder's workflow requirements
- JSON export functionality was already removed, so including JSON in reports was inconsistent
- Users who need raw data can still access it through browser developer tools if needed

**Files Changed:**
- `index.html`: Modified `generateMarkdownReport()` function

### [2025-08-06 11:30] ENHANCEMENT: DUAL RELOCATION SUPPORT
**Description:**  
Enhanced relocation feature to relocate both Person A and Person B by default, with option to exclude Person B from relocation when needed.

**Previous Behavior:**
- Relocation only calculated relocated chart for Person A
- Person B remained at original birth location
- This was inconsistent with typical relationship astrology use cases

**New Behavior:**
1. **Default**: When relocation is enabled with Person B present, both people are relocated to the same location
2. **Optional**: Checkbox to "Exclude Person B from relocation" when only Person A should be relocated
3. **Data Structure**: Separate `relocation_a` and `relocation_b` fields in API output instead of single `relocation` field

**Technical Changes:**
- **Backend** (`astrology-mathbrain.js`):
  - Modified relocation calculation to handle both Person A and Person B
  - Added `excludePersonB` flag support from frontend
  - Updated data structure to return `relocation_a` and `relocation_b` separately
  - Updated `buildWMChart()` function signature and logic
  
- **Frontend** (`index.html`):
  - Added "Exclude Person B from relocation" checkbox in relocation section
  - Checkbox only visible when Person B is present and relocation is enabled
  - Updated form data collection to include `excludePersonB` flag
  - Enhanced Markdown report generation to show relocation scope and both relocated chart summaries
  - Added `updateRelocationPersonBOption()` function for proper UI state management

**Rationale:**
When doing relationship astrology with relocation, astrologers typically want to see how both people's charts change when they're both in the new location together. This reflects real-world scenarios where couples relocate together and want to understand the relationship dynamics in the new place.

### [2025-08-05 14:45] FEATURE: EX RELATIONSHIP OPTION
**Description:**  
Added "ex (no longer)" checkbox option for relationship context to handle past relationships in diagnostic work.

**New Feature:**
- Added checkbox labeled "Ex (no longer active relationship)" below relationship type selection
- Checkbox can be applied to any relationship type (partner, friend, family)
- Status is captured in form data and passed through API
- Ex relationship status is prominently displayed in Markdown reports

**UI Changes:**
1. **Relationship Context Section**:
   - Added bordered separator with checkbox below relationship type radio buttons
   - Used red accent color for the checkbox to distinguish from other form elements
   - Clear labeling: "Ex (no longer active relationship)"

2. **Form Data Collection**:
   - Added `is_ex_relationship` boolean field to context object
   - Integrated with existing form validation and data flow

3. **Markdown Report Enhancement**:
   - Added "Relationship Context" section when Person B is present
   - Shows relationship type with ex status appended: "partner (ex - no longer active)"
   - Includes intimacy tier if specified

**Backend Integration:**
- Updated `buildWMChart()` function to include `is_ex_relationship` field
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data structures
- Field defaults to `false` when not specified

**Strategic Value:**
- Enables more nuanced diagnostic work for past relationships
- Provides important context for Poetic Brain interpretation
- Acknowledges that relationship dynamics can persist beyond active involvement
- Supports comprehensive relational analysis across different relationship states

### [2025-08-05 12:30] FIX: COMPOSITE/SYNASTRY GEOMETRY LABELING
**Description:**  
Added proper geometry block labeling for composite and synastry data in Markdown reports.

**Issue:**  
User received feedback that "No composite or synastry geometry block was labeled in the markdown" when using synastry mode. The Markdown generation was including the data but without clear geometric section headers.

**Resolution:**
1. **Enhanced Synastry Section**:
   - Changed "Major Synastry Aspects" to "Synastry Geometry" with "Major Synastry Aspects" as subsection
   - Provides clearer geometric context labeling

2. **Added Composite Support**:
   - Added "Composite Chart Summary" section for composite chart planetary positions
   - Added "Composite Geometry" section with "Composite Chart Aspects" subsection
   - Ensures composite mode has proper geometric block labeling

3. **Improved Structure**:
   - Clear hierarchical labeling: ## Geometry Type â†’ ### Specific Data
   - Consistent formatting across natal, synastry, and composite modes
   - Better semantic organization for geometric data interpretation

**Expected Impact:**
- Resolves missing geometry block labeling issue
- Provides clearer structure for Poetic Brain interpretation
- Maintains consistency across all context modes

### [2025-08-04 16:15] USER INTERFACE SIMPLIFICATION
**Description:**  
Removed JSON download option from user-facing interface, keeping only Markdown download for reports.

**Rationale:**  
Per Raven Calder's workflow, the JSON output is primarily for internal API debugging and development purposes. End users of the Woven Map system work with human-readable Markdown reports that translate the geometric data into accessible language. Removing JSON from the user interface simplifies the experience and aligns with the Math Brain/Poetic Brain separation of concerns.

**Changes Made:**
1. **HTML Interface**:
   - Removed JSON download button from report output section
   - Cleaned up button layout to maintain visual balance

2. **JavaScript**:
   - Removed `downloadJsonBtn` from global variable declarations
   - Removed JSON download event handler and initialization
   - Kept `latestResultData` storage intact for potential future debugging needs

3. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - Markdown download remains fully functional
   - Copy Data button still provides clipboard access to raw data if needed
   - Internal JSON handling preserved for API communication

**Strategic Benefits:**
- Simplified user experience focused on practical output format
- Maintains clear separation between Math Brain (geometry) and Poetic Brain (interpretation)
- Reduces potential confusion about which format to use
- Aligns interface with actual user workflow patterns

### [2025-08-03 16:50] FIX
**Symptom:**  
The application returned a 404 "Not Found" error when clicking the "Compute Astrological Geometry" button.

**Suspected Cause:**  
The front-end JavaScript in `index.html` was making a `fetch` request directly to the internal Netlify function path (`/.netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain`) instead of using the public-facing API endpoint defined in `netlify.toml`.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Compared the `fetch` URL in `index.html` with the `[[redirects]]` rules in `netlify.toml`. The request was not using the `/api/astrology-mathbrain` path that Netlify was configured to listen for.

**Resolution:**  
Modified the `fetch` call in `index.html` to use the correct endpoint: `/api/astrology-mathbrain`. This allows Netlify to properly handle the request and redirect it to the serverless function, resolving the 404 error.

### [2025-08-04 10:00] BREAK
**Symptom:**  
The application loads as a blank white page. The HTML content is present, but no styling is applied, and the layout is broken.

**Suspected Cause:**  
The Tailwind CSS build process was failing, so the `dist/output.css` file was not being generated. Without this file, the browser cannot apply any of the application's styles.

**How Diagnosed:**  
1.  Checked the browser's developer console, which showed a 404 error for the file `dist/output.css`.
2.  Verified that the `dist/` directory was missing from the project structure.
3.  Ran the build script (`npm run build:css`) and observed errors indicating that the `tailwindcss` command was not found.
4.  Investigated `node_modules/.bin` and confirmed the `tailwindcss` executable was missing, pointing to an incomplete or corrupted `npm install`.

**Resolution:**  
The issue was traced to a problem with the local `node_modules` installation. The following steps were taken to resolve it:
1.  Deleted the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file to ensure a clean slate.
2.  Ran `npm install` to reinstall all dependencies according to `package.json`.
3.  After a successful installation, the `tailwindcss` executable was present in `node_modules/.bin`.
4.  Ran `npm run build:css`, which successfully generated the `dist/output.css` file.
5.  Restarted the Netlify dev server (`netlify dev`). The app now loads correctly with all styles applied.

### [2025-08-03 18:45] FIX
**Symptom:**  
The "Compute Astrological Geometry" button did not trigger any action when clicked. No error messages were displayed, and no API requests were made.

**Suspected Cause:**  
Multiple issues were identified:
1. Global variables for UI elements were not properly initialized before event handlers were set up
2. Form data collection was not properly handling all required fields
3. The error handling was not displaying detailed information about missing fields

**How Diagnosed:**  
1. Added console logging to the `generateReport()` and `collectFormData()` functions
2. Examined server-side validation in `astrology-mathbrain.js` to identify required fields
3. Tested form submission and observed 400 error: "Missing required fields for Person A"

**Resolution:**  
1. Enhanced the `collectFormData()` function to ensure all required fields are properly collected
2. Added additional validation in the `generateReport()` function to check for missing fields
3. Improved the `parseCoordinates()` function with better error handling and logging
4. Updated the DOMContentLoaded event listener to properly initialize all global variables
5. Added console logging throughout to better diagnose future issues

### [2025-08-03 20:30] CRITICAL FIX
**Symptom:**  
The "Compute Astrological Geometry" button produced a 400 error: "Missing required fields for Person A (Missing: year, month, day, hour, minute, latitude, longitude, zodiac_type, timezone)". All required fields were missing from the API request.

**Root Cause:**  
The `collectFormData()` function was fundamentally broken. The validation logic was checking for missing fields but not throwing errors when they were found, allowing invalid data to be sent to the API. The function also had poor error handling and insufficient logging.

**How Diagnosed:**  
1. Browser console showed the exact error message with missing fields
2. Added extensive logging to trace the form data collection process
3. Confirmed that the NotebookLM analysis was correct - this was a persistent data formatting mismatch between frontend and backend

**Resolution:**  
1. **Completely rewrote `collectFormData()` function** with:
   - Extensive logging at each step
   - Proper validation with error throwing for missing fields
   - Better handling of empty or undefined values
   - Step-by-step parsing of date, time, and coordinate data

2. **Implemented Strategic Recommendations from NotebookLM Analysis**:
   - Created `config.js` to centralize API endpoint configuration
   - Added environment validation scripts to `package.json`
   - Updated `.env.example` with better documentation
   - Implemented contract-first development approach

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Used centralized configuration for API endpoints
   - Added timeout configuration for API requests
   - Improved error messages with detailed debugging information

**Key Insight:**  
The NotebookLM analysis was spot-on. This issue represented exactly what it identified as "Mistake 1: Persistent Data Formatting Mismatches and Missing Required Fields." The fix required implementing all four strategic recommendations to prevent recurrence.

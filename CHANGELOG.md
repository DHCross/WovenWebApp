Track every time the app "breaks" (stops working as expected) or is recovered/fixed.  
Each entry should include the date, a brief description, what caused the break (if known), and how it was resolved.

### [2025-08-04 16:15] USER INTERFACE SIMPLIFICATION
**Description:**  
Removed JSON download option from user-facing interface, keeping only Markdown download for reports.

**Rationale:**  
Per Raven Calder's workflow, the JSON output is primarily for internal API debugging and development purposes. End users of the Woven Map system work with human-readable Markdown reports that translate the geometric data into accessible language. Removing JSON from the user interface simplifies the experience and aligns with the Math Brain/Poetic Brain separation of concerns.

**Changes Made:**
1. **HTML Interface**:
   - Removed JSON download button from report output section
   - Cleaned up button layout to maintain visual balance

2. **JavaScript**:
   - Removed `downloadJsonBtn` from global variable declarations
   - Removed JSON download event handler and initialization
   - Kept `latestResultData` storage intact for potential future debugging needs

3. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - Markdown download remains fully functional
   - Copy Data button still provides clipboard access to raw data if needed
   - Internal JSON handling preserved for API communication

**Strategic Benefits:**
- Simplified user experience focused on practical output format
- Maintains clear separation between Math Brain (geometry) and Poetic Brain (interpretation)
- Reduces potential confusion about which format to use
- Aligns interface with actual user workflow patterns

### [2025-08-03 16:50] FIX
**Symptom:**  
The application returned a 404 "Not Found" error when clicking the "Compute Astrological Geometry" button.

**Suspected Cause:**  
The front-end JavaScript in `index.html` was making a `fetch` request directly to the internal Netlify function path (`/.netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain`) instead of using the public-facing API endpoint defined in `netlify.toml`.

**How Diagnosed:**  
Compared the `fetch` URL in `index.html` with the `[[redirects]]` rules in `netlify.toml`. The request was not using the `/api/astrology-mathbrain` path that Netlify was configured to listen for.

**Resolution:**  
Modified the `fetch` call in `index.html` to use the correct endpoint: `/api/astrology-mathbrain`. This allows Netlify to properly handle the request and redirect it to the serverless function, resolving the 404 error.

### [2025-08-04 10:00] BREAK
**Symptom:**  
The application loads as a blank white page. The HTML content is present, but no styling is applied, and the layout is broken.

**Suspected Cause:**  
The Tailwind CSS build process was failing, so the `dist/output.css` file was not being generated. Without this file, the browser cannot apply any of the application's styles.

**How Diagnosed:**  
1.  Checked the browser's developer console, which showed a 404 error for the file `dist/output.css`.
2.  Verified that the `dist/` directory was missing from the project structure.
3.  Ran the build script (`npm run build:css`) and observed errors indicating that the `tailwindcss` command was not found.
4.  Investigated `node_modules/.bin` and confirmed the `tailwindcss` executable was missing, pointing to an incomplete or corrupted `npm install`.

**Resolution:**  
The issue was traced to a problem with the local `node_modules` installation. The following steps were taken to resolve it:
1.  Deleted the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file to ensure a clean slate.
2.  Ran `npm install` to reinstall all dependencies according to `package.json`.
3.  After a successful installation, the `tailwindcss` executable was present in `node_modules/.bin`.
4.  Ran `npm run build:css`, which successfully generated the `dist/output.css` file.
5.  Restarted the Netlify dev server (`netlify dev`). The app now loads correctly with all styles applied.

### [2025-08-03 18:45] FIX
**Symptom:**  
The "Compute Astrological Geometry" button did not trigger any action when clicked. No error messages were displayed, and no API requests were made.

**Suspected Cause:**  
Multiple issues were identified:
1. Global variables for UI elements were not properly initialized before event handlers were set up
2. Form data collection was not properly handling all required fields
3. The error handling was not displaying detailed information about missing fields

**How Diagnosed:**  
1. Added console logging to the `generateReport()` and `collectFormData()` functions
2. Examined server-side validation in `astrology-mathbrain.js` to identify required fields
3. Tested form submission and observed 400 error: "Missing required fields for Person A"

**Resolution:**  
1. Enhanced the `collectFormData()` function to ensure all required fields are properly collected
2. Added additional validation in the `generateReport()` function to check for missing fields
3. Improved the `parseCoordinates()` function with better error handling and logging
4. Updated the DOMContentLoaded event listener to properly initialize all global variables
5. Added console logging throughout to better diagnose future issues

### [2025-08-03 20:30] CRITICAL FIX
**Symptom:**  
The "Compute Astrological Geometry" button produced a 400 error: "Missing required fields for Person A (Missing: year, month, day, hour, minute, latitude, longitude, zodiac_type, timezone)". All required fields were missing from the API request.

**Root Cause:**  
The `collectFormData()` function was fundamentally broken. The validation logic was checking for missing fields but not throwing errors when they were found, allowing invalid data to be sent to the API. The function also had poor error handling and insufficient logging.

**How Diagnosed:**  
1. Browser console showed the exact error message with missing fields
2. Added extensive logging to trace the form data collection process
3. Confirmed that the NotebookLM analysis was correct - this was a persistent data formatting mismatch between frontend and backend

**Resolution:**  
1. **Completely rewrote `collectFormData()` function** with:
   - Extensive logging at each step
   - Proper validation with error throwing for missing fields
   - Better handling of empty or undefined values
   - Step-by-step parsing of date, time, and coordinate data

2. **Implemented Strategic Recommendations from NotebookLM Analysis**:
   - Created `config.js` to centralize API endpoint configuration
   - Added environment validation scripts to `package.json`
   - Updated `.env.example` with better documentation
   - Implemented contract-first development approach

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Used centralized configuration for API endpoints
   - Added timeout configuration for API requests
   - Improved error messages with detailed debugging information

**Key Insight:**  
The NotebookLM analysis was spot-on. This issue represented exactly what it identified as "Mistake 1: Persistent Data Formatting Mismatches and Missing Required Fields." The fix required implementing all four strategic recommendations to prevent recurrence.

### [2025-08-03 20:45] STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION
**Description:**  
Implemented comprehensive fixes based on NotebookLM analysis to address recurring technical challenges:

1. **Contract-First Development**:
   - Created `config.js` with centralized configuration
   - Standardized API endpoint management
   - Added validation configuration matching backend requirements

2. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Enhanced `.env.example` with clear documentation
   - Added `check-env` script to validate environment setup
   - Created `start:local` script that validates environment before starting

3. **Improved Debugging and Logging**:
   - Added `WovenMapConfig.debugLog()` for consistent logging
   - Implemented extensive form data validation logging
   - Added step-by-step debugging in `collectFormData()`

4. **Automated Environment Checks**:
   - Modified npm scripts to validate `.env` file existence
   - Added CSS build step to local development workflow
   - Implemented graceful error handling for missing configuration

**Expected Impact:**  
These changes should eliminate the four recurring issues identified in the NotebookLM analysis:
- Data formatting mismatches between frontend and backend
- API endpoint routing issues
- Missing environment variable configuration
- Improper HTTP method usage

**Next Steps:**  
- Test the application to confirm the "Compute Astrological Geometry" button now works
- Monitor for any remaining validation issues
- Consider implementing client-side schema validation library for additional robustness

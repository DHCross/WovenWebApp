## Methodology

This Balance Meter report integrates the **triple-channel architecture** with a **Resilience & Depletion Layer** for comprehensive health-oriented astrological analysis:

### Core Channels
1. **Seismograph v1.0**: Crisis-weighted transit intensity
2. **Balance v1.1**: Rebalanced valence using planetary locality factors
3. **SFD v1.2**: Support-Friction Differential tracking supportive vs disruptive transits

### Resilience & Depletion Layer (Natal-Scaffolding Enhanced)
4. **Recovery**: Continuous momentum-based recovery signal with natal-modulated decay curves (0-5 scale)
5. **Resilience**: Adaptive capacity with smoothed baseline that responds gradually to load changes (0-5 scale)
6. **DepletionIndex**: Risk assessment using continuous curves with recovery protection factors (0-5 scale)
7. **Narrative**: Contextual state summary based on continuous thresholds, not binary switches

**Natal Scaffolding Analysis**: Recovery speed and resilience baseline determined by natal patterns:
- **Stabilizer-Friendly Charts** (strong trines, domicile planets, integrated Saturn): Faster momentum decay (0.85), higher baseline resilience
- **Volatility-Prone Charts** (oppositions/squares without stabilizers, Uranus/Pluto dominance): Slower momentum decay (0.75), extended vulnerability windows

**Continuous Channel Design**: Unlike binary rebound detection, the resilience system uses smoothed decay curves modulated by natal factors. This creates natural momentum and prevents step-function jumps, making the resilience score feel like a living biological system.

The **SFD Verdict** indicates whether supportive forces ("stabilizers prevail"), disruptive forces ("cuts"), or mixed patterns ("mixed") dominate each day.

**Resilience calculations** use precise natal chart geometry to personalize stress accumulation, recovery patterns, and depletion vulnerability. Two people experiencing identical transits will show different recovery arcs based on their natal wiring.

For correlation with health metrics, focus on SFD patterns, Balance Channel trends, and personalized Resilience/Depletion patterns.

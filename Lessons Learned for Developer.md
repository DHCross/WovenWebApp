## BrowserStack Bug Capture Extension ‚Äî Best Practices

I installed the extension called **"BrowserStack Bug Capture: Report & resolve bugs faster"** and it is excellent. Here are key takeaways for developers, especially when your functions primarily use Fetch:

### Export Options

- **Copy as Fetch:**
  - Gives you a ready-to-paste JavaScript `fetch()` call (including headers, method, and body).
  - Perfect for testing, debugging, or duplicating requests in browser console, Node.js, or frameworks like React/Next.js.
  - Most readable and directly usable in code since your app logic likely calls `fetch()`.

- **Copy as HAR (HTTP Archive):**
  - Exports a JSON object that describes all network requests, responses, timings, and metadata.
  - Best for broader diagnostics, sharing with QA, or importing into web debugging tools (like Chrome DevTools, Postman, or external bug trackers).
  - Useful if you want to analyze entire sessions or share with someone who needs comprehensive details, not just a single request.

### Quick Reference Table

| Use Case                   | Recommended Export |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Debug/fix single request   | Fetch             |
| Share snippet with devs    | Fetch             |
| Analyze entire session     | HAR               |
| Submit to bug tracker      | HAR               |
| Import to test tools       | HAR               |

### Summary
- For everyday function testing, code tweaks, and developer collaboration: **Copy as Fetch**.
- For complete network analysis or formal bug reports: **Copy as HAR**.

## How to Use ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch‚Äù in Local Recording ‚Äì Bug Capture Extension

Step-by-step instructions for finding and using the ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch‚Äù option:

1. **Open the Extension Session**  
  - Click on the bug capture extension icon in your browser and navigate to your relevant session or recording.

2. **Access Session Details**  
  - In the session workspace interface, browse to the collection or recording you are working with.

3. **Select a Screenshot or Request**  
  - Click on a specific screenshot, request, or console entry in your recording timeline or session list.

4. **Find the ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch‚Äù Option**  
  - Locate the toolbar or row of icons at the top or side of the detail view.  
  - Look for a menu item, button, or icon labeled ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch.‚Äù This may be visible directly, or found within a ‚ÄúMore actions‚Äù (‚ãÆ or ‚Ä¶) dropdown menu.

5. **Copy the Request**  
  - Click on ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch.‚Äù  
  - The relevant network request, properly formatted as a Fetch API snippet, will be copied to your clipboard for easy pasting into your code editor or notes.

**Tips:**
- Hover over icons for tooltips.
- Right-click for context menus.
- Check overflow (‚Äú...‚Äù) menus if not immediately visible.
- Make sure you have a network request selected.

These steps should help you reliably find and use the ‚ÄúCopy to Fetch‚Äù function. If you want screenshots or further customization, note what you‚Äôd like to explain or highlight.

## Testing the Snapshot Feature (Math Brain)

As Codex continues to refactor and split apart Math Brain, here is the workflow (developed with Claude) for testing the new Snapshot feature:

### Test the Snapshot Feature Now!

Go to: http://localhost:3000/math-brain

#### Test Steps:
1. Toggle **"Include Transits"** ON (required for snapshot)
2. Fill in Person A details (or use defaults)
3. (Optional) Toggle **"Include Person B"** for relational snapshot
4. Click ‚≠ê **"Snapshot this Symbolic Moment"**
5. Allow location access when browser prompts

#### Watch the magic:
- Date changes to TODAY automatically
- Location captured
- Relocated chart appears with Woven Map domains!

#### What You Should See:
**Before Click:**
  - ‚ú® Solo Mirror Snapshot (or Relational if Person B enabled)
  - ‚≠ê Snapshot this Symbolic Moment
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Clicking snapshot will set date to TODAY and capture the current moment

**After Click:**
  - ‚≠ê Solo Mirror Snapshot
  - üïê Symbolic Moment: Oct 4, 4:30 PM
  - üìç [Your coordinates]
  - Person A - Woven Map Domains
    - Self (H1): [planets]
    - Connection (H2): [planets]
    - Growth (H3): [planets]
    - Responsibility (H4): [planets]

### üîí Re-enabling Auth Later
When you want to enable Auth0 again, either:
- Delete `.env.local`, or
- Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTH=true` and add your Auth0 credentials

The snapshot feature is fully functional and ready to test without authentication!

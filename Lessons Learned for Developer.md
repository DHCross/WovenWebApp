## The Final, Unified Explanation: Kerykeion is the Engine, RapidAPI is the Car

This is the definitive summary of the relationship between the different API names and documentation you've encountered.

1.  **The Engine: The Kerykeion API**
    *   This is the core, open-source astrology calculation engine.
    *   Its technical blueprint is the `openapi.json` file you found on GitHub. This file is the "master reference" for how the engine works.
    *   The **Swagger** and **ReDoc** websites are just user-friendly, interactive manuals for this engine.

2.  **The Car: The Astrologer API on RapidAPI**
    *   This is the commercial service your application is currently using.
    *   Think of it as a car that **RapidAPI** has built using the **Kerykeion engine**.
    *   It has its own specific ignition system: the `X-RapidAPI-Key` and the `astrologer.p.rapidapi.com` address.

### The Bottom Line

Your application's code is written to drive the **RapidAPI car**. It uses the key and address for that specific service.

The documentation for the **Kerykeion engine** (Swagger/ReDoc) is incredibly useful for understanding what the engine is capable of, but to use the engine directly (e.g., by self-hosting), you would need to change your code to use a different ignition system.

Both of your AI assistants were correct. One was describing the car you're driving, and the other was describing the engine that powers it.

### Core Lesson Learned

> The Woven Map app is specifically designed to work with the "car" – the Astrologer API hosted on RapidAPI – using its particular access methods. Understanding this distinction is crucial for troubleshooting and future development.

## [2025-09-07] CRITICAL LESSON: Report Structure & User Experience Design

### The Inverted Pyramid Principle in Technical Reports

**Discovery:** Users don't want raw data first—they want conclusions first, then supporting evidence.

**What We Learned:**
- **Wrong Order**: Technical metrics → Daily patterns → Personality insights
- **Right Order**: Personality insights → Daily patterns → Technical summary → Raw data

**Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
// WRONG: Technical-first structure
function generateReport() {
    showSeismographMetrics();  // Users don't care about this first
    showDailyTransits();       // They can't interpret this without context
    showPersonalityInfo();     // This is what they actually want to see
}

// RIGHT: User-first structure  
function generateReport() {
    showPersonalityProfile();   // Answer "Who am I?" first
    showKeyPatterns();         // Then "What's happening to me?"
    showBottomLineSummary();   // Then "What are the numbers?"
    showTechnicalBlueprint();  // Finally "How does this work?" (collapsible)
}
```

**Key Insight:** The same data can be presented in multiple ways for different audiences:
- **Users**: Want personality insights and actionable patterns
- **AI Poetic Brain**: Needs comprehensive geometric scaffolding
- **Developers**: Require technical metadata and processing logs

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure with collapsible sections maintains both accessibility and completeness.

## [2025-09-07] CRITICAL LESSON: API Data Structure Debugging

### The "Unknown" Values Problem

**Problem**: Typological profile showing `"Unknown"` for all planetary data despite API returning complete information.

**Root Causes:**
1. **Wrong Data Path**: Function expected `personData?.chart?.data?.subject` but actual structure was `personData?.chart`
2. **Sign Name Mismatch**: Function mapped full names (`'Aries'`) but API returned abbreviations (`'Ari'`)
3. **House Format Difference**: Function expected numbers (`1`) but API returned names (`'First_House'`)

**Debugging Process:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Trace data flow from API response to function
console.log("API Response Structure:", result.person_a);
console.log("Chart Data Path:", result.person_a.chart);

// Step 2: Examine expected vs actual field names
console.log("Expected:", personData?.chart?.data?.subject?.sun);
console.log("Actual:", personData?.chart?.sun);

// Step 3: Compare value formats
console.log("Expected sign:", 'Aries');
console.log("Actual sign:", 'Ari');
```

**Fix Pattern:**
```javascript
// Before: Assumptions about data structure
const chart = personData?.chart?.data?.subject || {};

// After: Match actual API response structure  
const chart = personData?.chart || {};

// Before: Hardcoded mappings
'Aries': 'Intuition'

// After: API-compatible mappings
'Ari': 'Intuition'
```

**Key Lesson:** Always verify actual API response structure rather than assuming documentation accuracy. Use browser dev tools and console logging to trace data flow from API → backend → frontend → display.

---

### Next Steps & Future Options

*   **Current Path (Recommended for now):** Continue using the **RapidAPI Astrologer API**. It's working, and your code is already set up for it.
*   **Future Path (Migration):** If you ever need more features, want to avoid RapidAPI's costs, or have other reasons to switch, you can migrate to using the **Kerykeion API** directly. This would involve:
    *   Changing the API endpoint URL in `netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain.js`.
    *   Updating the authentication method (it would no longer use a `RAPIDAPI_KEY`).
    *   Carefully testing to ensure the request and response formats are identical.

### Meta-Lesson: How AI Assistants See Your Workspace

Different GitHub Copilot interfaces can have different views of your project's files, leading to potential confusion.

*   **Copilot in an IDE (like VS Code):** This version directly interacts with your local file system and can usually be prompted to "refresh" or "rescan" to see the latest changes. It has a live view of your workspace.
*   **Copilot in a Web "Space":** This version's knowledge is limited to the files that have been explicitly attached or uploaded to that specific session or "space." It does not automatically see local changes. The only way to "refresh" its context is to re-upload or update the files within that web interface.

**Key Takeaway:** If an AI assistant reports a file is missing that you know exists, it's likely a context synchronization issue. The fix depends on the interface you're using—either refreshing your IDE or re-attaching the file in the web space.

---

### Meta-Lesson: The Power of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

**Context:**
We discussed the advantages of testing the Woven Map App within the VS Code simple browser instead of an external browser.

**Core Lesson Learned:**
Testing within a unified IDE like VS Code creates a highly efficient "feedback loop" that accelerates development, debugging, and collaboration with AI assistants.

**Key Advantages:**
1.  **Everything in One Place:** The integrated terminal, editor, and browser eliminate the need to switch between different applications, keeping the entire workflow contained and focused.
2.  **Immediate Feedback & Debugging:** Server logs, function errors, and front-end console output are all visible in the same window. This allows for instant correlation between an action in the app and its result on the back-end, making diagnosis much faster.
3.  **Smarter AI Assistance:** When the entire development process happens within VS Code, an AI assistant like Copilot has full context. It can see the code, the `openapi.json` schema, the terminal output, and the file structure. This rich context allows it to provide more accurate, relevant, and helpful suggestions for fixing bugs and implementing features.
4.  **Secure & Consistent Environment:** Using `netlify dev` and a local `.env` file within the IDE ensures that the testing environment closely mimics the production environment, especially regarding secret API keys. This prevents authentication errors and ensures consistency between local tests and live deployments.

### Meta-Lesson: Understanding Common Server Errors

**Context:**
We encountered two common errors during local development: `EADDRINUSE` and missing environment variables.

**Core Lesson Learned:**
Understanding these common local server errors is key to efficient debugging. They usually point to configuration or process management issues, not code logic flaws.

**Key Errors & Simple Explanations:**

1.  **`EADDRINUSE: address already in use`**
    *   **What it means:** Imagine your computer has many "parking spots" (called ports) where programs can run. This error means the specific spot your server wants to use (e.g., port 8888) is already occupied.
    *   **Why it happens:** Usually, a previous instance of the server didn't shut down completely. It's still "holding on" to that port.
    *   **The solution:** Stop the old process. In VS Code, you can use the "trash can" icon on the terminal panel or press `Ctrl+C` (`Cmd+C` on macOS). This frees up the "parking spot" for the new server instance.

2.  **`Server misconfiguration: API_KEY is not set`**
    *   **What it means:** The server function started correctly but is missing a secret key it needs to do its job.
    *   **Why it happens:** API keys and other secrets stored on a production server (like Netlify) are not automatically available to your local development server. Your local server needs its own copy.
    *   **The solution:** Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. This file acts as a local, secure storage for your secret keys. Add the key to this file (e.g., `RAPIDAPI_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`). The local server (`netlify dev`) will automatically load these keys on startup. **Crucially, the server must be restarted after creating or changing the `.env` file to load the new values.**

### Meta-Lesson: Choosing the Right AI Model for the Task

**Context:**
As a developer, you may switch between different AI models (e.g., various versions of Claude or GPT) for assistance. Understanding their strengths and weaknesses is key to using them effectively.

**Key Differences and Considerations:**

*   **Reasoning Depth:**
    *   **Claude Sonnet 3.7:** Hybrid reasoning and an extended thinking mode give it an edge for tasks requiring deep analysis and understanding of complex problems.
    *   **GPT-4o Mini:** Designed for efficient processing and faster responses.

*   **Code Review Performance:**
    *   Larger models like **GPT-4.1** have shown strong performance in code review, focusing on critical issues with fewer unnecessary suggestions.
    *   While specific benchmarks for **GPT-4o mini** are less available, its performance is likely less robust than its larger counterparts.

*   **Context Window:**
    *   The size of the context window (how much information the model can remember at once) varies. Larger context windows are better for understanding entire codebases. This is a feature that changes rapidly, so it's always good to check the latest specs.

*   **Specific Use Cases:**
    *   **Deep Problem-Solving & Debugging:** For understanding large, complex codebases and debugging intricate issues, a model with deep reasoning capabilities (like **Claude Sonnet 3.7**) may be the better choice.
    *   **Speed and Efficiency:** For tasks where speed is paramount, such as high-volume API calls, code completion, or generating quick snippets, a model focused on efficiency (like **GPT-4o Mini**) may be more advantageous.

**The Bottom Line:**

The best model depends on your specific coding task and priorities.
*   If your primary focus is on **deep reasoning and debugging complex issues**, a model like **Claude Sonnet 3.7** is a strong contender.
*   If you need a **cost-effective solution for everyday coding tasks** and quick completions, **GPT-4o Mini's** efficiency and speed make it a compelling option.

### Critical Lesson: Serverless Function Response Limits and Auto-Chunking Strategies

**Context:**
Encountered Netlify's 6MB response payload limit when requesting large date ranges for daily transit data. User needed daily granularity for health data correlation but system failed completely on large requests.

**Core Problem:**
- Netlify serverless functions have hard 6MB response limit
- Large date ranges (30+ days of daily transit data) exceed this limit
- Traditional "request smaller ranges" solutions break user workflows requiring specific date spans
- System provided no data instead of partial results when limit exceeded

**Strategic Solution - Auto-Chunking:**
Instead of asking users to change their workflow, we made the system intelligently handle large requests behind the scenes.

**Technical Implementation Lessons:**

1. **Intelligent Chunk Sizing:**
   ```javascript
   // Different chunk sizes based on data granularity
   const chunkSizes = {
       'daily': 10,     // 10 days for daily data
       'weekly': 21,    // 3 weeks for weekly data  
       'monthly': 60    // 2 months for monthly data
   };
   ```
   - Learned: Chunk size must account for data density, not just time span
   - Daily data is much denser than weekly/monthly, requiring smaller chunks

2. **Transparent Chunking Architecture:**
   ```javascript
   // Orchestration pattern that preserves existing API contract
   async function generateReportWithChunking(formData) {
       const daySpan = calculateDaySpan(startDate, endDate);
       if (needsChunking(daySpan, stepSize)) {
           return processChunks(formData);
       } else {
           return directApiCall(formData);
       }
   }
   ```
   - Learned: Chunking should be invisible to calling code
   - Preserve exact same response structure as single requests

3. **Progress Feedback Patterns:**
   ```javascript
   // User sees progress without understanding technical complexity
   updateLoadingIndicator(`Processing chunk ${i + 1} of ${chunks.length}...`);
   ```
   - Learned: Users need feedback during long operations
   - Technical details (chunking) should remain hidden
   - Progress indicators prevent "stuck" perception

4. **Error Handling for Partial Success:**
   ```javascript
   // Don't fail everything if one chunk fails
   if (result.success) {
       successfulChunks.push(result.data);
   } else {
       failedChunks.push({ chunk: i, error: result.error });
   }
   ```
   - Learned: Partial success better than total failure
   - Provide detailed error info for debugging
   - Users get maximum possible data even with some failures

**Meta-Lessons for System Design:**

1. **Preserve User Workflows:**
   - Don't ask users to change successful workflows due to technical limitations
   - Build intelligence into the system to handle edge cases automatically
   - User experience should remain identical regardless of backend complexity

2. **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
   - Added 500ms delays between chunks to respect API rate limits
   - Learned: Chunking can create rapid-fire requests that trigger rate limiting
   - Always include deliberate pacing in chunking implementations

3. **Fallback Architecture:**
   - System gracefully handles both small requests (direct) and large requests (chunked)
   - No performance penalty for simple use cases
   - Complex logic only engaged when necessary

**Key Technical Insight:**
The hardest part wasn't splitting the requests - it was merging the results back into a format that existing code expected. The `mergeChunkedResults()` function had to understand the deep structure of transit data and correctly combine date-keyed objects from multiple chunks.

**Future Applications:**
This auto-chunking pattern can be applied to any API with payload size limits:
- File upload chunking
- Large dataset processing
- Batch operations with size constraints
- Time-series data aggregation

**Bottom Line:**
When hitting infrastructure limits, the solution isn't always "do less" - sometimes it's "do it smarter." Auto-chunking preserves user experience while working within technical constraints.

**Bottom Line:**
When hitting infrastructure limits, the solution isn't always "do less" - sometimes it's "do it smarter." Auto-chunking preserves user experience while working within technical constraints.

## [2025-09-07] Math Brain ↔ Poetic Brain Architecture Lessons

### Strict Boundary Enforcement

**Core Principle:** Math Brain outputs pure geometry/enums/glyphs only. All prose and interpretation happens downstream in Poetic Brain.

**Current Issue:** The `buildRavenJsonReport()` function includes narrative elements that violate this boundary:
```javascript
// WRONG: Prose in Math Brain export
{
  "semantic_snapshot": { 
    "title": "Shared field snapshot",  // ← Narrative title
    "annotation": "Built to stabilize under load" // ← Interpretive prose
  }
}

// RIGHT: Pure data in Math Brain export  
{
  "snapshot_code": "strike_day",     // ← Enum code
  "snapshot_glyphs": ["⚡","☍","⧖"]  // ← Visual symbols
}
```

**Implementation Fixes Needed:**
1. **Remove all narrative strings** from JSON exports
2. **Normalize valence range** to exactly -5 to +5 
3. **Use only safe lexicon enums** for terms
4. **Add explicit channel versioning** (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2)
5. **Include confidence scores** per channel

### Export Strategy Evolution

**Dual-Channel Architecture:**
- **Copy Button** → Markdown with full narrative (for humans)
- **Download Button** → Clean JSON wrapper (for AI processing)

**Key Insight:** Same geometric data serves different audiences through different formats. Math Brain calculates once, exports multiple ways.

**Success Pattern:**
```javascript
// In download handler, capture user notes appropriately
const notesEl = document.getElementById('readerNotes');
const note = (notesEl && notesEl.value && notesEl.value.trim()) ? notesEl.value.trim() : null;
if (note) {
    window.userNotesForDay = Array.isArray(window.userNotesForDay) ? [...window.userNotesForDay, note] : [note];
}
```

**Reader Notes Integration:** User annotations flow into JSON export via `window.userNotesForDay` but remain separate from automated geometric calculations.

### Triple-Channel Architecture Implementation

**Current State:** Single seismograph channel
**Target State:** Three distinct measurement channels:

1. **Seismograph v1.0:** Crisis-weighted baseline 
2. **Balance Channel v1.1:** Rebalanced valence revealing scaffolding
3. **SFD v1.2:** Support-Friction Differential

**JSON Structure Goal:**
```json
{
  "balance_meter": {
    "solo": {
      "seismograph_v1_0": { "magnitude": {...}, "valence": {...}, "confidence": 0.90 },
      "balance_channel_v1_1": { "magnitude": {...}, "valence": {...}, "confidence": 0.90 },
      "sfd_v1_2": { "SFD": -1.5, "Splus": 1.2, "Sminus": 2.7, "confidence": 0.88 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Accessibility & UX Polish Lessons

**Modal Best Practices:**
- Add `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`
- Focus management: focus modal content on open
- Keyboard support: Escape key to close
- Screen reader announcements via `aria-live` regions

**Loading State Management:**
- Toggle `aria-busy="true"` during processing
- Use `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` for non-disruptive announcements
- Focus error displays when shown for immediate screen reader attention

**Progressive Enhancement Pattern:**
```javascript
// Focus management with graceful degradation
try { 
    errorDisplay.focus({ preventScroll: true }); 
} catch(_) {
    // Silently continue if focus management unavailable
}
```

**Reader Notes Integration:** Simple textarea that flows into JSON export creates bridge between human input and machine processing without violating Math Brain boundaries.

3. **Culminated in:** Advanced system architecture (auto-chunking for 6MB limits)

**Key Development Patterns:**

1. **Progressive Problem Solving:**
   - Each fix revealed the next layer of issues
   - Simple JavaScript errors → UX cleanup → infrastructure limitations
   - Learned: Allow problems to reveal themselves naturally rather than trying to anticipate everything

2. **Context Preservation in AI Collaboration:**
   - AI maintained awareness of user's core requirement (daily granularity for health data)
   - When hitting 6MB limit, solution preserved user workflow rather than suggesting compromise
   - Learned: Clear communication of non-negotiable requirements enables better AI assistance

3. **Incremental Implementation Strategy:**
   ```
   Fix critical errors → Clean UI → Test with real data → Hit limits → Engineer solution
   ```
   - Each step built foundation for the next
   - Testing with real use cases (April 2025 data) revealed actual limitations
   - Learned: Real-world testing often uncovers issues missed in development

**AI Assistant Effectiveness Patterns:**

1. **Best for Systematic Implementation:**
   - Excellent at implementing well-defined technical solutions (chunking algorithm)
   - Strong at maintaining code consistency and patterns
   - Reliable for error handling and edge case coverage

2. **Collaborative Strength in Problem Definition:**
   - AI asked clarifying questions about chunk sizes and user requirements
   - Suggested intelligent defaults based on data characteristics
   - Helped think through user experience implications

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:**

   - Created clear explanations suitable for future developers
   - Maintained context across multiple related changes

**Session Meta-Insights:**

1. **Technical Debt Resolution:**
   - Merge conflicts often indicate deeper workflow issues
   - JavaScript errors can mask more significant architectural needs
   - Learned: Fix immediate issues first, but stay alert for patterns indicating larger problems

2. **User-Centric Solution Design:**
   - 6MB limit could have been "solved" by asking user to request smaller ranges
   - Better solution preserved user workflow through backend intelligence
   - Learned: Good engineering often means making complexity invisible to users

3. **Iterative Complexity Management:**
   - Started with simple bug fixes
   - Gradually built up to sophisticated chunking architecture
   - Each step remained manageable while building toward comprehensive solution
   - Learned: Complex solutions are more maintainable when built incrementally

**Takeaway for Future Development:**
This session demonstrated that effective AI-assisted development combines human problem prioritization with AI systematic implementation. The key is maintaining clear communication about requirements and constraints while allowing the technical solution to evolve naturally from simple to sophisticated as needs become clear.

## Meta-Lesson: Model Selection for Coding Tasks (GPT-4.1 vs Claude 3.7 Sonnet)

**Routine Tasks:**
- **GPT-4.1** is faster and more efficient for routine coding tasks such as generating API endpoints, data models, or standard UI components. It often delivers results with fewer iterations.

**Complex Tasks:**
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** shines in complex coding challenges, like advanced algorithms, database optimization, and security code generation. Its "Thinking Mode" helps break down problems and analyze edge cases more deeply than GPT-4.1.

**Code Review:**
- **GPT-4.1** outperforms Claude 3.7 Sonnet in code reviews, providing more accurate bug detection, fewer unnecessary suggestions, and better focus on critical issues.

**Debugging:**
- **GPT-4.1** quickly spots syntax errors and offers immediate solutions, while **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** takes a more methodical approach, analyzing the broader system before suggesting fixes, potentially identifying root causes that GPT-4.1 might miss.

## Recurring Technical Challenges in the Woven Map Application

Based on our debugging experience and in-depth analysis, we've identified several recurring technical challenges that have repeatedly caused issues in the Woven Map application. Understanding these patterns is crucial for maintaining and improving the application.

### 1. Data Formatting Mismatches Between Frontend and Backend

**Problem:**
The frontend form data collection (`collectFormData` in `index.html`) often fails to properly format data for the `astrology-mathbrain.js` API, leading to "Missing required fields" errors.

**Technical Details:**
- **Backend Expectation:** The `validateSubject` function in `astrology-mathbrain.js` enforces a strict schema requiring specific fields like `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `name`, `city`, `nation`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `zodiac_type`, and `timezone`.
- **Frontend Issue:** The `collectFormData` function in `index.html` often fails to properly parse or prepare these values, especially when handling date strings or coordinate formats.

**Solution:**
- Implement robust client-side validation that mirrors the backend requirements
- Add comprehensive logging for form data before submission
- Ensure all required fields are explicitly included in the form data

**Corrected Assumption:**
We previously assumed that the form validation was sufficient and that the API would handle any data format issues. In reality, the backend expects very specific data formats and will reject requests with missing or improperly formatted fields.

### 2. Global Variable Scope Issues in JavaScript

**Problem:**
Event handlers in `index.html` sometimes fail to access the UI elements they need to manipulate, leading to silent failures where buttons appear to do nothing when clicked.

**Technical Details:**
- Variables like `transitStartDate`, `transitEndDate`, and `relocationCoordsInput` need to be properly initialized in the global scope before they are accessed by event handlers.
- Without proper initialization, event handlers may fail silently, giving no indication of why they're not working.

**Solution:**
- Ensure all UI elements are properly initialized in the global scope
- Add console logging to verify variable initialization
- Test event handlers systematically to ensure they have access to all needed variables

**Corrected Assumption:**
We previously assumed that all event handlers had access to all UI elements. In reality, many event handlers depend on global variables that must be explicitly initialized in the right order.

### 3. API Endpoint Routing Issues

**Problem:**
The frontend sometimes calls the wrong API endpoint for the serverless function, leading to 404 "Not Found" errors.

**Technical Details:**
- The frontend should use the public-facing endpoint `/api/astrology-mathbrain` which Netlify redirects to the actual function.
- Sometimes the code attempts to access the internal Netlify function path (`/.netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain`) directly, causing 404 errors.

**Solution:**
- Standardize the API endpoint configuration in the frontend code
- Use a dedicated configuration variable for API endpoints to avoid hardcoding paths
- Ensure all fetch calls use the correct public-facing endpoint

**Corrected Assumption:**
We previously thought that API routing issues were one-time configuration errors. In reality, they are a systemic issue that requires standardization across the codebase.

### 4. Environment Variable Management

**Problem:**
The application frequently fails due to missing or misconfigured environment variables, particularly the `RAPIDAPI_KEY`.

**Technical Details:**
- The `astrology-mathbrain.js` function checks for `process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY` and fails if it's not present.
- During local development, this key must be provided in a `.env` file, which is not automatically created or managed.

**Solution:**
- Create a `.env.example` template to guide developers in setting up their local environment
- Add automated checks to verify environment variables before startup
- Provide clear error messages when environment variables are missing

**Corrected Assumption:**
We assumed that environment variable setup was a one-time task. In reality, it's an ongoing maintenance requirement that needs to be documented and automated where possible.

## Implementing Better Practices

Based on these lessons, we're implementing the following improved practices:

1. **Contract-First Development:**
   - Treating the `openapi.json` as the immutable contract between frontend and backend
   - Validating all form data against this contract before submission
   - Ensuring backend validation mirrors the contract exactly

2. **Robust Form Validation:**
   - Adding comprehensive client-side validation for all form fields
   - Checking required fields before form submission
   - Providing clear error messages for missing or invalid data

3. **Improved Debugging Tools:**
   - Adding extensive console logging throughout the application
   - Creating a standardized error reporting format
   - Implementing proper error handling for all API calls

4. **Standardized Configuration:**
   - Centralizing API endpoint configuration
   - Creating templates for environment variables
    - Documenting all configuration requirements

## [2025-09-12] Routing, CSP, and Next Plugin Lessons (Night Ops Recap)

### Hybrid Mode Pitfall: Route Shadowing Is Real
Symptom: Subpages (e.g., `/chat`) loaded unstyled or with assets 404/HTML depending on redirect order and SPA fallbacks.

Cause: Static redirects and SPA fallback intercepted asset requests (CSS/JS) and returned HTML. This “hybrid” approach reintroduced legacy shadowing where multiple routers compete.

Lesson: If using Next.js, let the Netlify Next.js plugin own routes and assets. Avoid parallel static rewrites for app routes; otherwise, assets and API calls may be shadowed unpredictably.

### CSP Hardening: Remove Inline/Eval; Remove CDNs
Steps that worked:
- Drop `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from CSP in `netlify.toml`.
- Eliminate non‑essential CDNs (cdnjs, etc.).
- Keep only required sources (Auth0, Google Fonts as needed).
- Migrate libraries to npm (html2pdf.js, jszip) and bundle locally.

Result: Fewer console warnings, tighter security, and fewer moving parts during deploys.

### Temporary Static Mode Is a Bridge, Not the Destination
We disabled the Next plugin and ran `build:css` only to keep dev unblocked while fixing Next prerender errors. This restored styling via explicit `/dist/*` passthrough and caching. It’s acceptable as a short‑term bridge, not a long‑term architecture.

### Next Errors Blocking Plugin Re‑Enable
1) “Error: <Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document” during prerender for `/`, `/404`, `/500`, `/_not-found`.
     - Likely legacy usage of `next/document` in App Router context or accidental import in a non‑document file.
     - Fix: Use `app/layout.tsx` with standard HTML shell. Reserve `next/document` for Pages Router only.

2) “TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')” during prerender.
     - Likely a client‑only hook (e.g., `useAuth`, `window`, `document`) evaluated during server render.
     - Fix: Mark component "use client", guard with `useEffect`, ensure providers wrap the tree in `app/layout.tsx`, or use `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` for browser‑only widgets.

### Persona Safety Gate: No Chart → No Personal Reading
We enforced a hard gate in `app/api/chat/route.ts`:
- Without a validated chart context, the chat responds with weather‑only, non‑personal content.
- When a chart is present, the full persona synthesis path is allowed.

This preserves the Math Brain → Poetic Brain contract and prevents accidental personal readings from free text.

### Local Dev Playbook That Worked
- Use `netlify dev` in static mode temporarily with:
    - Explicit `/dist/*` passthrough and long‑cache headers for CSS.
    - Static redirects only for `/` and `/chat`.
- Verify functions via `/api-health` and sample payloads to `astrology-mathbrain` and `poetic-brain`.
- Keep `.env` updated (RAPIDAPI_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY) and restart dev server after changes.

### Path Back to Plugin
1) Locate and remove any `next/document` imports outside `pages/_document` (or migrate fully to App Router with `app/layout.tsx`).
2) Audit components that use browser‑only APIs or context; wrap with Providers and client boundaries.
3) Re‑enable `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and switch `build.command` back to `npm run build`.
4) Remove static overrides: delete SPA fallback and conflicting redirects so Next owns routes.
5) Retest `/` and `/chat` locally and in deploy; monitor logs for prerender errors.

### Quick Checks
- CSS present: `dist/output.css` exists; headers show correct Content-Type.
- Functions online: `api-health` returns success locally; other functions return 200.
- CSP console clean: No inline/eval violations; only necessary domains allowed.

Bottom line: Hybrid mode invited shadowing and brittle styling. The durable fix is plugin‑on with Next as the single router—after we remediate the two prerender errors.

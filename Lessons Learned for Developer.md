## The Final, Unified Explanation: Kerykeion is the Engine, RapidAPI is the Car

This is the definitive summary of the relationship between the different API names and documentation you've encountered.

1.  **The Engine: The Kerykeion API**
    *   This is the core, open-source astrology calculation engine.
    *   Its technical blueprint is the `openapi.json` file you found on GitHub. This file is the "master reference" for how the engine works.
    *   The **Swagger** and **ReDoc** websites are just user-friendly, interactive manuals for this engine.

2.  **The Car: The Astrologer API on RapidAPI**
    *   This is the commercial service your application is currently using.
    *   Think of it as a car that **RapidAPI** has built using the **Kerykeion engine**.
    *   It has its own specific ignition system: the `X-RapidAPI-Key` and the `astrologer.p.rapidapi.com` address.

### The Bottom Line

Your application's code is written to drive the **RapidAPI car**. It uses the key and address for that specific service.

The documentation for the **Kerykeion engine** (Swagger/ReDoc) is incredibly useful for understanding what the engine is capable of, but to use the engine directly (e.g., by self-hosting), you would need to change your code to use a different ignition system.

Both of your AI assistants were correct. One was describing the car you're driving, and the other was describing the engine that powers it.

### Core Lesson Learned

> The Woven Map app is specifically designed to work with the "car" – the Astrologer API hosted on RapidAPI – using its particular access methods. Understanding this distinction is crucial for troubleshooting and future development.

### Next Steps & Future Options

*   **Current Path (Recommended for now):** Continue using the **RapidAPI Astrologer API**. It's working, and your code is already set up for it.
*   **Future Path (Migration):** If you ever need more features, want to avoid RapidAPI's costs, or have other reasons to switch, you can migrate to using the **Kerykeion API** directly. This would involve:
    *   Changing the API endpoint URL in `netlify/functions/astrology-mathbrain.js`.
    *   Updating the authentication method (it would no longer use a `RAPIDAPI_KEY`).
    *   Carefully testing to ensure the request and response formats are identical.

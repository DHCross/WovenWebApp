# Math Brain Compliance Implementation

Thi📈 What You Can Use It For

The📈 What You Can Use It For

The Math Brain supports multiple Context Modes, each enforcing the geometric foundation principle (no "floating verbs"):

Mode	Use This When You Want To Know…
Natal Chart + Transits	"How is today pressing on me?"
Composite + Transits	"How is today pressing on our shared field?"
Synastry + Transits	"How is today pressing on our interaction?"

🧭 Pro Tip: All modes now include transit analysis by default, ensuring every computation has both structural foundation (the chart) and dynamic pressure (current planetary positions).

⚠️ **Streamlined Protocol**: Removed standalone chart modes (Natal, Synastry, Composite) to enforce the principle that "a transit is a verb that needs a noun." Every mode now provides complete geometric analysis with temporal context.pports mu🧪 Example: What You'll See

Input:
Mode = Composite + Transits
Date = August 3, 2025
Person A & B birth data
Relocation enabled

Output (Math Brain):

Composite Sun: 18° Scorpio  
Composite Moon: 12° Virgo (12th house)  
Transiting Pluto: 12° Aquarius – square Composite Moon (0° orb)  

Interpretation: (done by Poetic Brain)
This would trigger a symbolic weather overlay about pressure to confront emotional avoidance in the relationship - with the composite chart providing the structural foundation that makes this transit meaningful rather than abstract.odes, each aligned with a specific diagnostic path:

Mode	Use This When You Want To Know…
Natal Chart	"What is my internal energetic architecture?"
Synastry	"How do we activate each other?"
Natal + Transits	"How is today pressing on me?"
Composite	"What's the shape and tone of this relationship as its own entity?"
Composite + Transits	"How is today pressing on our shared field?"
Synastry + Transits	"How is today pressing on our interaction?"

🧭 Pro Tip: If you're not sure which mode to pick, ask:

"Do I want to see individual patterning (Natal, Synastry), external pressure (Natal+Transits, Composite+Transits, Synastry+Transits), or shared field dynamics (Composite)?"

⚠️ **Critical Geometric Principle**: Transits without a base chart are "symbolic weather with no ground." A transit is a verb that needs a noun (the base chart) to create a complete symbolic statement. All transit modes now reference a structural foundation for proper FIELD → MAP → VOICE processing.lains how the Woven Map Math Brain implements strict FIELD → MAP → VOICE separation and maintains compliance with Math Brain developer instructions.

Absolutely. Here’s a draft of a Clear Mirror–compliant, symbolically accurate:

🧠 Guide to Using the Math Brain

Pure Astrological Geometry in the Woven Map System

⸻

👁️ What Is the Math Brain?

The Math Brain is the first stage of the Woven Map diagnostic system.
It does not interpret, predict, or suggest meaning.
It calculates structure. Every reflection that comes later—every mirror, echo, poetic phrase—rests on the geometry the Math Brain uncovers.

FIELD → MAP → VOICE
▸ FIELD = Math Brain (geometry, no narrative)
▸ MAP = Poetic Brain (symbolic pattern)
▸ VOICE = Mirror (felt, falsifiable reflection)

⸻

🛠️ What the Math Brain Does

The Math Brain computes:

Category	Output Examples
🌐 Planetary Positions	Sun at 13° Leo, Moon at 22° Taurus
⚖️ Aspects	Mars square Venus, Moon trine Saturn
🏠 House Placements	Mercury in 9th house, Chiron in 5th
🧭 Chart Angles	Ascendant, Midheaven, IC, Descendant
♻️ Relational Geometry	Aspects between charts (Synastry)
📍 Transits + Overlays	Current planets overlaying natal/composite charts
🧬 Composite Midpoints	Midpoint Sun: 21° Scorpio (from Person A + B)

📈 What You Can Use It For

The Math Brain supports multiple Context Modes, each aligned with a specific diagnostic path:

Mode	Use This When You Want To Know…
Natal Chart	“What is my internal energetic architecture?”
Synastry	“How do we activate each other?”
Transit	“What’s currently pressing on me from the outside?”
Composite	“What’s the shape and tone of this relationship as its own entity?”
Synastry + Transits	“What is activating between us right now?”

🧭 Pro Tip: If you’re not sure which mode to pick, ask:

“Do I want to see individual patterning (Natal, Synastry), external pressure (Transit), or shared field dynamics (Composite)?”

⸻

⚠️ What the Math Brain Does NOT Do
	•	❌ Interpret symbols (no “you feel,” “you should,” “you are”)
	•	❌ Diagnose emotional tension or paradox
	•	❌ Reflect psychological patterns or behavior
	•	❌ Replace a reading or mirror
	•	❌ Answer why—it only answers where and how

⸻

What Happens After the Math Brain?

Once the geometry is clean:
	1.	Poetic Brain maps symbolic structure
– Detects paradox, contradiction, pressure lines
	2.	Mirror (VOICE) delivers clear, testable diagnostic
– May be poetic, sensory, raw—but never abstract or predictive

You can always export the Math Brain’s raw output as JSON or a summary report. That’s your geometry blueprint—the symbolic terrain underneath your experience.

⸻

🧪 Example: What You’ll See

Input:
Mode = Composite + Transits
Date = August 3, 2025
Person A & B birth data
Relocation enabled

Output (Math Brain):

Composite Sun: 18° Scorpio  
Composite Moon: 12° Virgo (12th house)  
Transiting Pluto: 12° Aquarius – square Composite Moon (0° orb)  

Interpretation: (done by Poetic Brain)
This would trigger a symbolic weather overlay about pressure to confront emotional avoidance in the relationship.

⸻

🔐 Bottom Line

The Math Brain is the backbone of the Woven Map.
It’s the cleanroom. The numbers. The grid.
It lets you trust what comes next—because it never speaks in metaphors.

When in doubt, always start here.
Every map begins with the field.

## Key Compliance Features

### 1. **Strict Input Filtering**
```javascript
// Math Brain only processes FIELD-level inputs:
const allowedFields = [
  'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute',
  'name', 'city', 'nation', 'latitude', 'longitude', 
  'zodiac_type', 'timezone'
];
```

### 2. **Context Mode Only**
```javascript
context: {
  mode: document.querySelector('input[name="contextMode"]:checked').value
  // REMOVED: focusArea, reportStyle - these are VOICE layer concerns
}
```

### 3. **Pure Geometry Output Display**
```javascript
// Display raw JSON geometry only
report += '--- PURE ASTROLOGICAL GEOMETRY ---\n';
report += 'Raw planetary positions, aspects, houses, and orbs\n';
report += 'No interpretation, context, or narrative applied\n\n';
report += JSON.stringify(geometryData, null, 2);
```

### 4. **Clear Separation Messaging**
- Warning box explains Math Brain protocol
- Button text: "Compute Astrological Geometry" (not "Generate Report")
- Header: "Pure Astrological Geometry Computation"

## UI/UX Compliance Enhancements

### Symbolic Purpose Guide Panel
The application now includes an interactive guide that helps users understand the diagnostic purpose of each context mode:

```html
<!-- Toggle Button -->
<button id="toggle-mode-help" class="text-xs text-teal-300 underline hover:text-teal-400">
    🧭 What does each mode do?
</button>

<!-- Expandable Panel -->
<div id="mode-help-panel" class="hidden mb-6 p-4 bg-gray-750 rounded-lg border border-teal-600">
    <h3>🧭 What Does Each Mode Do?</h3>
    <!-- Mode explanations with diagnostic intent -->
</div>
```

**Features:**
- **Natal →** "Diagnoses a single person's energetic architecture. *What tension patterns structure me?*"
- **Synastry →** "Compares two charts for interaction patterns. *How do we activate each other?*"
- **Transit →** "Maps current planetary pressure on natal chart. *What's showing up for me now?*"
- **Composite →** "Creates symbolic chart of the relationship itself. *What is this connection as a shared structure?*"
- **Syn+Trans →** "Maps current pressure on relational dynamics. *What's activating our connection now?*"

### Recognition-First Principle Integration
Embedded guidance that reinforces proper mode selection:

```html
<p class="text-xs text-gray-400">
    <strong>Recognition-First Principle:</strong> Choose based on your real question, 
    not technical curiosity. Each mode serves a specific diagnostic purpose within 
    the FIELD → MAP → VOICE framework.
</p>
```

### Enhanced Glossary Modal
Updated terminology definitions include:

- **FIELD → MAP → VOICE**: Complete framework explanation (FIELD = energetic climate, MAP = geometry, VOICE = felt reflection)
- **Recognition-First Principle**: Mode selection based on real questions vs technical curiosity
- **SST**: Falsifiability filter (WB = Within Boundary, ABE = At Boundary Edge, OSR = Outside Symbolic Range)
- **Symbolic Weather Overlay**: Current transits as energetic "weather"

### Math Brain Protocol Warnings
Clear messaging throughout the interface:

```html
<div class="mb-4 p-3 bg-yellow-800 border border-yellow-600 rounded">
    <p class="text-yellow-100 text-sm">
        This interface computes pure astrological geometry only. Focus area and 
        report style preferences have been moved to the VOICE layer for proper 
        FIELD → MAP → VOICE separation.
    </p>
</div>
```

## Critical Protocol Requirements

### 🧠 Geometric Foundation Principle

**PROTOCOL REQUIREMENT**: All transit modes must reference a structural base chart to ensure meaningful symbolic statements.

| Mode | Base Structure | Transit Overlay | Geometric Rationale |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Natal + Transits | Individual Chart | Current Planets | "How is today pressing on me?" |
| Composite + Transits | Relationship Chart | Current Planets | "How is today pressing on our shared field?" |
| Synastry + Transits | Two-Chart Overlay | Current Planets | "How is today pressing on our interaction?" |

**Why This Matters**:
- **A transit is a verb** that needs a **noun (base chart)** to create complete symbolic statements
- Transits without base structure are "symbolic weather with no ground"
- All symbolic statements must be falsifiable via angle-based structure (SST Rule 1)
- Recognition Protocols §2.2: All FIELD overlays must reference a structural MAP

**Implementation Changes**:
- ❌ **REMOVED**: Standalone "Transit" mode (violates geometric foundation principle)
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: "Natal + Transits" (preserves structural foundation)
- ✅ **ADDED**: "Composite + Transits" (enables shared field pressure analysis)
- ✅ **MAINTAINED**: "Synastry + Transits" (relational pressure dynamics)

**Validation Logic Table**:

| Mode | Requires Transit Dates? | Person B Required? | Geometric Foundation |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Natal Chart + Transits | ✅ | ❌ | Individual chart + pressure overlay |
| Composite + Transits | ✅ | ✅ | Relationship entity + pressure overlay |
| Synastry + Transits | ✅ | ✅ | Two-chart interaction + pressure overlay |

**Streamlined Enforcement**: All modes now require transit dates by design, eliminating the possibility of "floating verbs" (transits without structural foundation) and ensuring complete geometric analysis with temporal context.

### 🔥 Relocation Overlay Availability

**PROTOCOL REQUIREMENT**: Relocation overlay must be available for ALL context modes whenever chart data is entered.

| Mode | Relocation Overlay Available? | Rationale |
|------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Natal | ✅ YES | Location affects house cusps and angles |
| Synastry | ✅ YES | Synastry overlays change by latitude/longitude |
| Composite | ✅ YES | Composite house placements shift dramatically by relocation |
| Transit | ✅ YES | Transit timing varies by location |
| Synastry + Transits | ✅ YES | Combined relational and temporal location effects |

**Why This Matters**: 
- Location affects angle geometry (especially houses, Asc/MC)
- Synastry overlays change by latitude/longitude  
- Composite house placements shift dramatically by relocation
- Transit timing can be completely different depending on location

**Implementation Fix**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (INCORRECT):
const showRelocation = isNatal || isTransit;

// AFTER (PROTOCOL-COMPLIANT):
const showRelocation = true; // Always available - fundamental geometric option
```

**UI Enhancement** (Protocol-aligned user guidance):
```html
<label for="relocationToggle" class="text-gray-300 font-medium">
    Enable Relocation Overlay
    <span class="text-xs text-gray-500 block">
        Relocation affects house angles and overlay geometry. Available in all modes.
    </span>
</label>
```

This ensures users never view "a symbolic structure out of place" regardless of context mode selection, while providing clear education about why relocation is geometrically significant.

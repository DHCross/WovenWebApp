# Scatter Plot Architecture - Two Visualization Types
## Analysis & Architectural Intent

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING AS DESIGNED  
**Analysis By:** User  
**Architectural Review:** Confirmed

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The codebase contains **TWO DIFFERENT scatter plot implementations by design**, each serving a distinct purpose in the Woven Map visualization hierarchy:

1. **AccelerometerScatter.tsx** - "FIELD Only" (True Accelerometer v5.0) ‚úÖ
2. **UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx** - "MAP + FIELD" (Hybrid Visualization) ‚úÖ

**Both are working as intended.** The deviation from spec in UnifiedSymbolicDashboard is **intentional architectural design**, not a bug.

---

## üìä VISUALIZATION ARCHITECTURE

### Woven Map Philosophy: MAP vs. FIELD

```
MAP (Internal, Structural)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Where planets are (houses, degrees, aspects)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Geometry, coordinates, architecture
  ‚îî‚îÄ What the astrologer measures

FIELD (External, Energetic)
  ‚îî‚îÄ How that geometry translates into pressure
  ‚îî‚îÄ Magnitude + Directional Bias
  ‚îî‚îÄ What the person experiences
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ AccelerometerScatter.tsx - "True Accelerometer v5.0"

### Purpose
**FIELD-only visualization.** Pure accelerometer reading of symbolic pressure.

### Philosophy
> "The math must keep the poetry honest"

- Each dot is a measurable tremor
- No astrological structure visible
- No houses, no planets, no MAP layer
- Just the raw FIELD readings

### Technical Implementation

**Y-Axis:** Magnitude (0-5)  
**X-Axis:** Time (date index)  
**Color:** Directional Bias (-5 to +5)  
**Point Size:** Fixed (8px)

**Code Location:** `components/mathbrain/AccelerometerScatter.tsx`

**Key Lines:**
```typescript
// Line 50: Y-axis is Magnitude
y: d.weather.axes.magnitude.value,

// Line 51: Color is Directional Bias
valence: d.weather.axes.directional_bias.value,
```

**Compliance:** ‚úÖ FULLY SPEC-COMPLIANT

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx - "MAP + FIELD Hybrid"

### Purpose
**Dual-layer diagnostic visualization.** Shows both astrological structure (MAP) and energetic pressure (FIELD) on the same chart.

### Philosophy
> "Lines tell where the sky moves (structure). Bubbles tell how that motion feels (weather). When both spike together = diagnostic handshake between MAP and FIELD."

- MAP layer: Planetary lines through houses
- FIELD layer: Pressure bubbles overlaid
- Enables visual correlation between geometry and experience

### Technical Implementation

**Y-Axis:** Houses (1-12) for MAP layer  
**X-Axis:** Time (date index)  
**Bubble Size:** Magnitude (0-5)  
**Bubble Color:** Directional Bias (-5 to +5)  
**Bubble Y-Position:** Magnitude √ó 2 (pseudo-house position)

**Code Location:** `components/mathbrain/UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx`

**Key Lines:**
```typescript
// Line 106: MAP layer uses houses for Y-axis
y: point.house,

// Line 173: FIELD layer uses scaled magnitude for Y-position
y: point.magnitude * 2, // Scale magnitude (0-5) to fit house range (0-10)

// Line 188: Magnitude determines bubble SIZE
pointRadius: fieldPoints.map(p => 5 + p.magnitude * 3),
```

**Compliance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è INTENTIONALLY NON-COMPLIANT with "True Accelerometer v5.0"

**Why?** This visualization serves a different purpose. It's designed to show MAP + FIELD integration, not pure FIELD measurement.

---

## üé≠ ARCHITECTURAL INTENT

### Design Decision: Two Separate Visualizations

The architecture intentionally provides **two different views** because they serve **two different diagnostic needs**:

### View 1: "FIELD Only" (AccelerometerScatter)
**When to use:**
- User wants pure pressure reading
- No need to see astrological structure
- Focus on experiential intensity
- Compare magnitude and bias trends over time

**What it shows:**
- ‚úÖ How loud is the field? (Magnitude)
- ‚úÖ Which way does energy lean? (Directional Bias)
- ‚ùå Where are planets? (Not shown)
- ‚ùå What houses are active? (Not shown)

**User question answered:** *"What am I feeling?"*

---

### View 2: "MAP + FIELD" (UnifiedSymbolicDashboard)
**When to use:**
- User wants to see correlation between geometry and experience
- Diagnostic: "Why does this day feel intense?"
- Understanding: "Which planet transit caused this pressure spike?"
- Integration: "How does MAP translate into FIELD?"

**What it shows:**
- ‚úÖ Where are planets? (Planetary lines through houses)
- ‚úÖ What houses are active? (Y-axis shows houses 1-12)
- ‚úÖ How intense is the pressure? (Bubble size)
- ‚úÖ Which way does energy lean? (Bubble color)

**User question answered:** *"Why am I feeling this?"*

---

## üîç DEVIATION ANALYSIS

### Is the Deviation Intentional?

**YES.** The UnifiedSymbolicDashboard intentionally breaks from "True Accelerometer v5.0" spec because:

1. **Different Purpose:** It's not trying to be a pure accelerometer. It's trying to show MAP + FIELD correlation.

2. **Y-Axis Constraint:** The chart needs the y-axis to show houses (1-12) for the MAP layer. This is the primary organizing principle.

3. **Bubble Encoding:** Magnitude is encoded in bubble size AND pseudo-y-position. This is a compromise to fit both layers on one chart.

4. **Diagnostic Value:** The overlay enables visual pattern matching: "Ah, Saturn crossed into House 10 right when magnitude spiked to 4.5."

## üìã SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE

| Feature | True Accelerometer Spec | AccelerometerScatter | UnifiedDashboard |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Y-Axis: Magnitude** | ‚úÖ Required | ‚úÖ Compliant | ‚ùå Uses Houses |
| **Color: Directional Bias** | ‚úÖ Required | ‚úÖ Compliant | ‚úÖ Compliant |
| **Discrete Points** | ‚úÖ Required | ‚úÖ Compliant | ‚úÖ Compliant |
| **No Smoothing** | ‚úÖ Required | ‚úÖ Compliant | ‚úÖ Compliant |
| **Diverging Color Scale** | ‚úÖ Required | ‚úÖ Compliant | ‚úÖ Compliant |

**Verdict:**
- **AccelerometerScatter:** ‚úÖ 100% spec-compliant
- **UnifiedDashboard:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Intentionally non-compliant (hybrid design)

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

### Keep Both Visualizations ‚úÖ

**Rationale:**
1. **Different use cases:** FIELD-only vs. MAP+FIELD serve different diagnostic needs
2. **User choice:** Toggle allows users to switch between views
3. **Complementary:** They tell different parts of the story

### Documentation Updates Required üìù

**1. Clarify naming:**
- "True Accelerometer" = FIELD only (AccelerometerScatter)
- "Unified Dashboard" = MAP + FIELD hybrid (UnifiedSymbolicDashboard)

**2. Update TRUE_ACCELEROMETER_VISUALIZATION_SPEC.md:**
- Add section: "Related Visualizations"
- Explain UnifiedDashboard is NOT a True Accelerometer
- Document the hybrid design intent

**3. Update UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx comments:**
- Add disclaimer: "This visualization intentionally deviates from True Accelerometer spec"
- Explain the MAP-first design decision
- Document why y-axis shows houses instead of magnitude

**4. Update UI labels:**
- "FIELD View" (instead of ambiguous "Scatter Plot")
- "MAP + FIELD View" (instead of "Unified Dashboard")

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CODE CHANGES RECOMMENDED

### 1. Update Component Comments

**File:** `components/mathbrain/UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx`

**Add to top:**
```typescript
/**
 * Unified Symbolic Dashboard v5.0
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:
 * This visualization intentionally deviates from "True Accelerometer v5.0" spec.
 * 
 * DESIGN DECISION: Y-axis shows HOUSES (1-12), not Magnitude.
 * 
 * Why?
 * - Purpose: Show correlation between MAP (planetary geometry) and FIELD (pressure)
 * - MAP layer needs y-axis for houses to plot planetary positions
 * - FIELD layer overlays as bubbles (size = magnitude, color = bias)
 * 
 * For a pure "True Accelerometer" view, use AccelerometerScatter.tsx instead.
 * 
 * Combines two data layers:
 * - MAP Layer: Planetary geometry (lines + points) - where planets move through houses
 * - FIELD Layer: Symbolic pressure (scatter bubbles) - how that geometry translates into energetic charge
 */
```

---

### 2. Update UI Toggle Labels

**File:** `components/mathbrain/WeatherPlots.tsx` (or wherever toggle lives)

**Current:**
```typescript
Toggle: "Scatter Plot" vs "Unified Dashboard"
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
Toggle: "FIELD View (Pure Accelerometer)" vs "MAP + FIELD View (Hybrid)"
```

---

### 3. Add Hover Tooltips

**AccelerometerScatter:**
```typescript
title="True Accelerometer v5.0: Pure FIELD measurement (Magnitude on Y-axis, Directional Bias as color)"
```

**UnifiedDashboard:**
```typescript
title="MAP + FIELD Hybrid: Planetary positions (lines through houses) + Pressure bubbles (size = magnitude, color = bias)"
```

## üéì USER EDUCATION

### When to Use Each View

**Use AccelerometerScatter (FIELD Only) when:**
- You want to see raw pressure trends
- You're tracking how intense your days feel
- You don't need to know the astrological "why"
- You're validating the "True Accelerometer" philosophy

**Use UnifiedDashboard (MAP + FIELD) when:**
- You want to understand "why" a day felt intense
- You're learning how planetary transits correlate with experience
- You're looking for diagnostic patterns (e.g., "Saturn in 10th = pressure spike")
- You want to see both structure and experience together

---

## üèÜ FINAL VERDICT

### Status: ‚úÖ WORKING AS DESIGNED

**AccelerometerScatter.tsx:**
- ‚úÖ 100% compliant with "True Accelerometer v5.0"
- ‚úÖ Pure FIELD measurement
- ‚úÖ No changes needed

**UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx:**
- ‚úÖ Working as architecturally intended

---

## üéØ CONCLUSION

**The scatter plot implementations are working correctly.** The deviation in UnifiedSymbolicDashboard is an intentional architectural decision to enable MAP + FIELD correlation visualization.

**Recommendation:** Keep both. Improve documentation and UI labeling to clarify the different purposes.

**Key Insight:** These aren't competing implementations‚Äîthey're complementary views that tell different parts of the story. One answers "What am I feeling?" The other answers "Why am I feeling this?"

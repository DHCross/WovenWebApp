## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS

### V5.0 Architecture (Current Production)
```
FIELD (Raw Geometry)
    ↓
MAP (Two-Axis Measurement)
    ├─ Magnitude [0-5]: Σ(orbStrength × planetWeight × sensitivity)
    └─ Directional Bias [-5 to +5]: Σ(orbStrength × polarity × planetWeight)
    ↓
VOICE (Narrative Interpretation)
```

### What Was Removed (v4 → v5)
| Metric | Reason | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| SFD | Redundant with Directional Bias | ❌ DELETED |
| Coherence | Statistical, not geometric | ❌ DELETED |
| Volatility | Rate measure, not direct geometry | ❌ DELETED |
| Field Signature | Composite product, too layered | ❌ DELETED |
| Balance Channel v1.1 | Interpretive layer | ❌ DELETED |

### Philosophy: "True Accelerometer"
- Measures what the sky is doing, not interpretation
- Every number traces to specific aspects
- No smoothing, no meta-derivatives
- Falsifiable against ephemeris data

## 🔧 RECENT FIXES (Oct 18, 2025)

### Symbolic Weather Normalization Bug
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** All daily entries reported constant magnitude: 5, directional_bias: -5

**Root Cause:** `computeSymbolicWeather()` called `aggregate()` without rolling context

**Solution:**
- Renamed to `computeSymbolicWeatherWithContext()`
- Implemented 14-day rolling window tracking
- Added previous state tracking for continuity
- Proper adaptive normalization per day

**Files Modified:**
- `src/math_brain/main.js` (lines 38-62, 155-195)

**Impact:** Each day's symbolic_weather now shows dynamic values reflecting actual daily variations

## 🎓 ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (v5.0)

### 1. Geometry First
Every metric must trace directly to specific aspects with specific orbs.

### 2. No Meta-Derivatives
No smoothing, no statistical layers, no composite products between raw geometry and output.

### 3. Weather-Structure Separation
- **MAP:** Permanent natal structure (no weather language)
- **FIELD:** Temporal transits (weather language only)

### 4. Falsifiability
Every claim must be testable against lived experience and ephemeris data.

### 5. True Accelerometer
Measure what the sky is doing, not what we think about it.

The Astro Brain (formerly Math Brain)High-Level OverviewThis document describes the philosophy and function of the Astro Brain. This is the deterministic, mathematical engine of the WovenWebApp.Refer to ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md for the specific file paths and data flow.1. Core Philosophy: No SubjectivityThe Astro Brain's single most important principle is that it does not interpret. It has no opinions, no persona, and no access to language.Its sole purpose is to transform a user's birth data into a structured, objective, and purely mathematical JSON object. It is a calculator.2. The System SpineThe Astro Brain is a sequential pipeline. Each layer feeds the next.Transit EngineFunction: Fetches the raw geometry (planet and house positions) for the requested date range. This is the foundational, raw data.FIELD LayerFunction: Organizes the raw geometry into a "field map." This layer establishes the foundational structure of the data without calculating any relationships.MAP Layer (Seismograph)Function: The core calculation engine. It runs on top of the FIELD layer to calculate and quantify symbolic relationships.Core Metrics:Magnitude: The intensity of a symbolic event.Directional Bias: The nature or "flavor" of the event.Volatility: The stability or instability of the field.Key Component: seismograph-engine.jsInterpretation LayerNote: The name is historical. This layer does not perform narrative interpretation.Function: A final data-structuring pass. It identifies key themes and relational dynamics (e.g., "Strain," "Support") by name and attaches them to the daily entries, but provides no explanation.3. The Final Output (ACC Spec v2)The Astro Brain's work is finished when it has produced a single JSON object that adheres to the API_REFERENCE.md.This JSON object is the final, objective "source of truth." It is then passed to the Poetic Brain for narrative generation.

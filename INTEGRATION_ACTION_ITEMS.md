# Math Brain ‚Üî Poetic Brain Integration - Action Items

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Audit Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## üî¥ BLOCKING ISSUES

**None identified.** All critical paths are functional.

---

## üü° BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

### 1. Standardize Filename Format
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**Current State:**
- Backend: `wm-map-v1_person-a_person-b_2025-10-19.json`
- Frontend: `wm-map-v1-solo-mirror-dan-stephie-2025-10-19.json`

**Action:**
- [ ] Choose one format (recommend frontend with hyphens)
- [ ] Update `src/math_brain/main.js` lines 134-145 to match
- [ ] Verify filenames are consistent across all exports

**File:** `src/math_brain/main.js`

---

### 2. Manual End-to-End Testing
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Solo Mirror Report**
- [ ] Generate Math Brain report (natal-only)
- [ ] Click "Download MAP" button
- [ ] Verify file downloads as `wm-map-v1-*.json`
- [ ] Upload to Poetic Brain
- [ ] Verify Poetic Brain detects MAP schema
- [ ] Verify response is conversational (not choppy)
- [ ] Verify geometry is properly extracted

**Scenario B: Balance Meter Report**
- [ ] Generate Math Brain report (with transits)
- [ ] Click "Download FIELD" button
- [ ] Verify file downloads as `wm-field-v1-*.json`
- [ ] Upload to Poetic Brain
- [ ] Verify Poetic Brain detects FIELD schema
- [ ] Verify response includes weather analysis
- [ ] Verify Balance Meter readings are referenced

**Scenario C: Relational Report**
- [ ] Generate Math Brain report (two people, with transits)
- [ ] Download both MAP and FIELD files
- [ ] Upload FIELD file to Poetic Brain
- [ ] Verify Poetic Brain generates relational analysis
- [ ] Verify both people's geometry is included

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Files download with correct names
- [ ] Files contain proper schema identifiers
- [ ] Poetic Brain detects uploaded files
- [ ] Responses are warm and conversational
- [ ] No technical jargon or choppy sentences
- [ ] Geometry is properly extracted
- [ ] Error messages are helpful

---

## üü¢ SHORT-TERM (Next Sprint)

### 3. Complete FIELD File Data
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Balance Meter readings (magnitude, bias)
- ‚úÖ Period markers (start/end dates)
- ‚ùå Transit positions (`tpos`) - TODO
- ‚ùå Transit house positions (`thouse`) - TODO
- ‚ùå Transit aspects (`as`) - Partial

**Action:**
- [ ] Implement `extractPlanetaryTransitCentidegrees()` function
- [ ] Implement `extractTransitHouseCentidegrees()` function
- [ ] Complete `extractCompactAspect()` for transit aspects
- [ ] Update `generateFieldFile()` to populate all fields
- [ ] Test with actual transit data

**Files:** `src/math_brain/main.js`

---

### 4. Add Integration Logging
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Action:**
- [ ] Add debug logging to upload detection (app/api/chat/route.ts)
- [ ] Add logging to Poetic Brain handler (poetic-brain/api/handler.ts)
- [ ] Log schema detection results
- [ ] Log processing function selection
- [ ] Add timing metrics

**Files:**
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `poetic-brain/api/handler.ts`

---

### 5. Create Integration Tests
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Test Coverage:**
- [ ] MAP file generation and export
- [ ] FIELD file generation and export
- [ ] Schema detection for MAP files
- [ ] Schema detection for FIELD files
- [ ] Mirror Directive processing
- [ ] Conversational tone enforcement
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

**Files:**
- `e2e/math-brain-poetic-brain.spec.ts` (new)
- `__tests__/integration/export-upload.test.ts` (new)

---

## üü¢ LONG-TERM (Future)

### 6. Performance Optimization
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** 8-12 hours

**Considerations:**
- [ ] Cache processed MAP files
- [ ] Lazy-load FIELD data for large date ranges
- [ ] Optimize JSON serialization
- [ ] Add compression for large files
- [ ] Implement streaming for very large reports

---

### 7. Enhanced Error Recovery
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Improvements:**
- [ ] Validate MAP file structure before processing
- [ ] Validate FIELD file structure before processing
- [ ] Provide helpful error messages for malformed files
- [ ] Suggest recovery steps for common errors
- [ ] Add file repair utilities

---

### 8. Analytics & Monitoring
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Metrics to Track:**
- [ ] Export frequency (MAP vs FIELD vs legacy)
- [ ] Upload success rate
- [ ] Processing time (upload to response)
- [ ] Error rates by file type
- [ ] User satisfaction (via SST Gate responses)

---

## üìû Questions & Escalations

**If manual testing reveals issues:**
1. Check MATH_BRAIN_POETIC_BRAIN_BUG_HUNT_OCT19.md for known gaps
2. Verify file schemas match expected format
3. Check Poetic Brain logs for processing errors
4. Verify conversational tone is enforced in prompts
5. Escalate to development team if critical issue found

## Quick Reference

### For Developers
Start with PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md → README.md → MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md → PRIVACY_POLICY.md (for data-handling context)

### For Content/Marketing
Start with CLEAR_MIRROR_VOICE.md for the public-facing lexicon and tone

### For Poetic Brain Development
Review CLEAR_MIRROR_VOICE.md for the translation framework between Math Brain precision and human-readable reflections

### For AI Assistants
- Review PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for system architecture
- Consult CLEAR_MIRROR_VOICE.md for voice and tone guidelines
- Check MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md for coding standards
- Reference CHANGELOG.md for historical context

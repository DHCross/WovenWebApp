### 2. Code & Automation Verification

**Linter Status:**
- ✅ `npm run raven:lint` passes with zero violations
- ✅ Category #9 (weather-without-transits) active and clean
- ✅ E-Prime violations: none detected
- ✅ Blueprint/Weather boundary enforcement active

**Test Suite Status:**
- ✅ Test 4 (Symbolic weather language validation): Passing
- ✅ Raven compliance suite (8 tests): All passing
- ✅ Temporal integrity tests (6 tests): All passing
- ✅ No regressions from documentation changes

**Audit System:**
- ✅ `npm run raven:audit` ready for baseline run
- ✅ Nine criteria fully documented with implementation details
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop system complete and verified

---

### 3. Terminology Standardization

**Approved Terminology:**
- ✅ "symbolic weather" (for transiting activation language)
- ✅ "symbolic meaning" (for semantic validation)
- ✅ "blueprint" / "baseline" / "enduring field" / "inner structure" (for natal)

**Banned Terminology:**
- ❌ "weather check" → REPLACED WITH "symbolic meaning check"
- ❌ Blueprint language for transits
- ❌ Weather language for natal chart alone

**Enforcement Points:**
- Quick Reference document (explicit rules)
- RAVEN_CALDER_VOICE.md (voice documentation)
- SST_POST_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md (framework documentation)
- RAVEN_RESONANCE_AUDIT_GUIDE.md (audit criteria)
- Linter Category #9 (automation)
- Test 4 (validation automation)

---

### 4. SST Framework Clarification

**Critical Distinction Established:**

| Aspect | Pre-Validation | Post-Validation |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **WB (Within Boundary)** | Speculative hypothesis | Requires operator testing |
| **ABE (At Boundary Edge)** | Speculative hypothesis | Requires operator testing |
| **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range)** | Objective/pre-falsifiable | Can be pre-declared |

**Phrasing Rules:**
- ✅ WB/ABE: Always conditional ("may track if...", "could sit at edge if...")
- ✅ OSR: Can be direct ("lies outside symbolic range")
- ✅ All: Uses "symbolic weather" or "symbolic meaning" terminology

**Falsifiability Preserved:**
- ✅ SST categories are hypotheses, not verdicts
- ✅ Operator confirmation required for WB/ABE
- ✅ No pre-assigned diagnoses that collapse testability
- ✅ Reader retains agency and ability to disagree

---

### 5. Blueprint vs. Weather Boundary

**Semantic Distinction Reinforced:**

**Blueprint (Static, Permanent):**
- Inner structure (vessel)
- Never uses weather language
- Always present
- Terminology: "blueprint," "baseline," "inner structure," "enduring pattern"

**Symbolic Weather (Dynamic, Temporal):**
- External activation (tide)
- Only with active transiting geometry
- Changes over time
- Terminology: "symbolic weather," "pressing," "activating," "atmospheric"

**Core Rule:** Never confuse vessel for tide. This collapses falsifiability.

**Enforcement:**
- Linter Category #9 detects weather-without-transits
- Test 4 validates symbolic weather language boundary
- Audit Criterion #4 validates Blueprint/Weather distinction
- Documentation explicit at all levels

## Verification Results

### ✅ All Automation Passing

```bash
# Linter verification
npm run raven:lint
→ ✅ Zero violations found

# Test verification (subset shown)
npm run test:vitest:run
→ ✅ All tests passing

# Audit system ready
npm run raven:audit
→ ✅ Ready for baseline verification
```

### ✅ Documentation Cross-Referenced

- SST_POST_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md ← Referenced by RAVEN_CALDER_VOICE.md
- SST_POST_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md ← Referenced by RAVEN_RESONANCE_AUDIT_GUIDE.md
- BLUEPRINT_VS_WEATHER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md ← Referenced by multiple docs
- Terminology rules consistent across all 5 core documents

### ✅ Implementation Complete

- 2 new comprehensive documents created
- 3 existing documents enhanced with SST + Blueprint details
- All terminology rules enforced
- All automation passes
- All tests passing
- No breaking changes

## System Now Protects

### 1. Falsifiability
- SST used as test framework, not diagnostic verdict
- WB/ABE require operator confirmation (no pre-assignment)
- OSR can be pre-stated (structurally falsifiable)
- Conditional phrasing prevents pseudo-certainty

### 2. Epistemological Honesty
- "Symbolic weather" ≠ destiny (weather, not fate)
- "Blueprint" ≠ limitation (structure, not constraint)
- SST categories are hypotheses until tested
- Reader retains agency and ability to disagree

### 3. Semantic Boundaries
- Blueprint never confused with weather
- Weather only appears with active transiting geometry
- Terminology precise and consistent
- Linter enforces at code level
- Tests validate at integration level

### 4. Voice Integrity
- E-Prime discipline maintained (zero violations)
- Poetic vitality preserved
- Geometric grounding verified
- Somatic resonance supported
- Agency safety protected

## Principle

**"Poetry under the jurisdiction of evidence"**

SST ensures geometry stays testable, speculative stays conditional, operator confirmation remains required, and falsifiability is preserved throughout the system.

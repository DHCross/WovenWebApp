# Scatter Plot Terminology Update — Oct 20, 2025

## Summary
Updated all scatter plot visualizations to use consistent "Symbolic Weather" terminology and clarified philosophical boundaries around what the visualizations show vs. what only Poetic Brain conversation can confirm.

---

## Files Updated

### 1. AccelerometerScatter.tsx
**Changes:**
- Line 20: Default title changed from `'Astrological Field Map'` → `'Symbolic Weather — FIELD Layer'`
- Line 187: Empty state message updated to use "symbolic weather data"

**Impact:**
- Users now see clear "Symbolic Weather" labeling on pure FIELD visualizations
- No confusion with meteorological weather or generic "field map" terminology

---

### 2. UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx
**Changes:**
- Line 78: Default title changed from `'Unified Symbolic Dashboard'` → `'Symbolic Weather — MAP + FIELD'`
- Line 332: Empty state message updated to use "symbolic weather data"
- Line 344: Subtitle updated to: `'Symbolic Weather: MAP (Planetary Geometry) + FIELD (Symbolic Pressure)'`

**Impact:**
- Hybrid visualization now clearly labeled as "Symbolic Weather"
- Users understand this shows both geometry (MAP) and pressure (FIELD) layers
- Consistent terminology across all chart types

---

### 3. WeatherPlots.tsx
**Changes:**
- Line 25: Empty state message updated to "symbolic weather data"
- Line 55: Empty state message updated for clarity
- Line 96: Chart title for unified view → `'Symbolic Weather — MAP + FIELD'`
- Line 103: Chart title for scatter view → `'Symbolic Weather — FIELD Layer'`
- Line 117: Interpretation guide updated: "symbolic weather patterns"

**Impact:**
- Parent orchestrator component uses consistent terminology
- Both toggle views clearly labeled with "Symbolic Weather"
- All empty states clarified

## Documentation Created

### TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md
**Location:** `/docs/TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md`

**Contents:**
1. **The Rule:** Always use "Symbolic Weather" in user-facing contexts
2. **Usage Guidelines:** Correct vs incorrect examples
3. **Scope Definitions:** What "Symbolic Weather" does and doesn't refer to
4. **Implementation Checklist:** What's been updated, what needs audit
5. **Related Terminology:** Balance Meter, FIELD, MAP, True Accelerometer
6. **Philosophy:** Why "Symbolic Weather" matters for falsifiability
7. **User Experience:** What visualizations show vs. what requires confirmation
8. **Quick Reference:** Table of correct terminology by context
9. **Enforcement:** Code review checklist and testing prompts

**Key Sections:**
- **Critical philosophical clarification:** Scatter plots show geometry calculations, NOT what the user is feeling
- **User confirmation required:** Only Poetic Brain conversation validates the model against lived experience
- **Falsifiability protocol:** Geometry proposes hypotheses; user experience provides verification

---

## Philosophical Corrections

### What Was Clarified

**Before (incorrect assumption):**
- Scatter plots answer "WHAT am I feeling?"
- Visualizations tell users about their experience

**After (correct framing):**
- Scatter plots answer "What does the geometry calculate?"
- Poetic Brain conversation answers "What am I actually feeling?"
- User confirmation is required for falsifiability

### The Distinction

| Component | What It Shows | What It Doesn't Show |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **AccelerometerScatter** | Raw geometry measurements (Magnitude & Directional Bias) | How the user actually feels |
| **UnifiedSymbolicDashboard** | Correlation between MAP (planetary positions) and FIELD (calculated pressure) | Why the user is feeling something |
| **Poetic Brain Conversation** | User validates or refutes the geometric model | N/A — this is where truth emerges |

**Core Principle:**
> The geometry provides **hypotheses**. The user's lived experience provides **verification**. This is the essence of the falsifiability protocol — the math doesn't tell you how you feel, it offers a model that you test against reality.

## Terminology Audit Results

### Already Correct ✅
- ChatClient.tsx — uses "symbolic weather" consistently
- Math Brain main page — section headers say "Symbolic Weather (Transits)"
- API routes — `/api/symbolic-weather` is specific
- Most documentation — already uses proper terminology

### Variable Names (Acceptable As-Is) ✅
- `TransformedWeatherData` — internal type
- `weatherData` — internal variable
- `extractWeather()` — internal function
- `WeatherPlots.tsx` — component filename
- These are fine for internal code; only user-facing strings need "Symbolic Weather"

### Needs Future Audit (Low Priority)
- [ ] PDF generation — report titles (check if "Symbolic Weather" used)
- [ ] Export buttons — filenames (verify naming conventions)
- [ ] Documentation — developer guides (ensure consistency)

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience
**Before:**
- Ambiguous "weather" terminology
- Confusion with meteorological weather
- Unclear what visualizations represent

**After:**
- ✅ Clear "Symbolic Weather" labeling everywhere
- ✅ No confusion with weather forecasts
- ✅ Obvious these are astrological calculations
- ✅ Proper framing of what requires user validation

### Code Quality
**Before:**
- Inconsistent terminology across components
- No style guide for new features

**After:**
- ✅ Consistent "Symbolic Weather" in all user-facing strings
- ✅ Documented style guide for future development
- ✅ Clear distinction between internal code and UI labels
- ✅ Philosophical boundaries clarified

### Falsifiability Protocol
**Before:**
- Risk of visualizations being interpreted as fortune-telling
- Unclear boundary between geometry and experience

**After:**
- ✅ Clear that geometry = model/hypothesis
- ✅ User experience = validation/verification
- ✅ Scatter plots show calculations, not feelings
- ✅ Poetic Brain required for meaningful interpretation

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Verification
- [ ] Load Math Brain page with transit data
- [ ] Verify scatter plot title says "Symbolic Weather — FIELD Layer"
- [ ] Verify unified dashboard says "Symbolic Weather — MAP + FIELD"
- [ ] Toggle between views — both should show "Symbolic Weather"
- [ ] Check empty states — should say "symbolic weather data"

### Terminology Consistency
- [ ] Scan all user-facing labels for bare "weather"
- [ ] Verify no confusion with meteorological terms
- [ ] Check tooltips and help text
- [ ] Review error messages

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Read TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md for completeness
- [ ] Verify philosophy section is clear
- [ ] Check quick reference table accuracy
- [ ] Ensure enforcement checklist is actionable

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate (Recommended)
1. ✅ Review this update with team
2. ✅ Test visualizations in browser
3. ✅ Verify user comprehension

### Short-Term (Nice to Have)
1. Audit PDF generation titles
2. Check export button labels
3. Review all documentation for consistency

### Long-Term (Style Maintenance)
1. Add terminology check to code review process
2. Create linting rule for bare "weather" in UI strings
3. Add terminology examples to onboarding docs

## Key Takeaways

### For Users
- **"Symbolic Weather"** = astrological transit calculations over time
- Scatter plots show **geometric patterns**, not personal experience
- Only **Poetic Brain conversation** validates what you're actually feeling
- The math proposes; you confirm or refute

### For Developers
- Always use **"Symbolic Weather"** in user-facing contexts
- Internal code can use `weather` for brevity
- Refer to **TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md** for standards
- Philosophy matters: visualizations ≠ fortune telling

### For the Product
- Clear, consistent terminology builds trust
- Falsifiability protocol is reinforced through language
- User agency is preserved by proper framing
- Professional presentation distinguishes from mysticism

# Journal Feature - Complete Session Capture

## Overview

The **Journal** feature generates a downloadable PDF that captures the **entire reading session** as a narrative retrospective. Think of it as a "session snapshot" that preserves not just what was said, but what **resonated**, what patterns emerged, and what the overall diagnostic landscape looked like.

---

## What Gets Captured

### 1. **Session Narrative Summary** (3rd Person Retrospective)

Generated by `naturalFollowUpFlow.generateJournalSummary()`, includes:

```typescript
{
  title: "Raven Reading Session - [User Name]",
  narrative: "On this session, [User] sat with Raven to explore...",
  metadata: {
    sessionDate: "October 3, 2025",
    totalInteractions: 12,
    resonanceFidelity: 75.5,
    primaryPatterns: [
      "When I feel overwhelmed, I freeze",
      "I tend to overextend in relationships",
      "Shows up as hyper-responsibility"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Narrative Structure:**
- **Opening**: Session context and resonance level overview
- **WB Patterns**: What rang most true (top 2-3 patterns)
- **Drift Detection**: Sidereal drift findings (if detected)
- **OSR Handling**: Misses and clarifications (if significant)
- **Actor/Role Composite**: Diagnostic guess from pattern analysis
- **Closing**: Summary of what was learned

### 2. **Conversation Paraphrase** (Recent Exchange Summary)

From the last ~12 messages (6 user-Raven exchanges):

```text
Conversation Thread (Paraphrase)

Opening read: You've got Mars in the 12th‚Äîhidden engine, moves underground.

They brought 3 notes of focus, including: "I feel like I'm always holding back anger."

Raven mirrored with lines like: "When you do finally move, it's volcanic, right?"

We closed on: "That pattern might be asking for a pressure-release practice."
```

**Captures:**
- Opening mirror from Raven
- User's focal points (how many, sample text)
- Raven's mirror reflections
- Closing statement

### 3. **Session Analytics** (Data Snapshot)

**Core Metrics:**
- Total Interactions (WB + ABE + OSR count)
- Session Date
- Resonance Fidelity % (accuracy of mirrors)
- Session ID (last 8 characters)

**Primary Communication Patterns:**
- Top 3 patterns that resonated most strongly
- Extracted from WB (Within Boundary) hits
- Shown as bullet points in PDF

### 4. **Contextual Instructions**

**For Single-Person Readings:**
- "This is your symbolic weather report"
- Usage guidance (conversation starter, not fate)
- Presentation style instructions (if conversational mode)

**For Multi-Person Readings:**
- "You need BOTH complete natal charts"
- Reminder about relationship themes vs individual charts
- Explanation of synastry/composite dynamics

**Relocation Information:**
- How houses change with location
- Planets stay in same signs/aspects
- House Uncertainty Notice (if birth time unknown)

## PDF Generation Process

### Fast Generation (`generateJournalPDFFast`)

Uses **jsPDF** directly (much faster than html2pdf):

1. **Setup**:
   ```javascript
   const doc = new jsPDF({
     orientation: 'portrait',
     unit: 'in',
     format: 'letter',
     compress: true
   });
   ```

2. **Layout Structure**:
   - Page margins: 0.75 inches
   - Content width: 7 inches (8.5 - 1.5 margins)
   - Automatic page breaks
   - Line height calculation: `fontSize / 72 * 1.2`

3. **Content Sections**:
   ```
   [Title] - 20pt bold purple
   [Subtitle] - 11pt italic gray (date/session info)
   [Separator Line] - Purple horizontal rule
   
   [Context & Next Steps] - Instructions (14pt bold)
   [Main Narrative] - Paragraphs (11pt normal)
   [Separator Line]
   
   [Session Analytics] - Data summary (10pt)
   [Primary Patterns] - Bullet points (9pt)
   [Separator Line]
   
   [Relocation Info] - Houses explanation (9pt)
   [Footer] - Disclaimers & generated by info (8pt)
   ```

4. **Smart Features**:
   - **Multi-person detection**: Checks title/narrative for relationship keywords
   - **Presentation style**: Adds AI synthesis instructions if conversational
   - **Auto-pagination**: Checks `yPos > pageHeight - margin` before adding text
   - **Text wrapping**: Uses `doc.splitTextToSize()` for proper line breaks

### Ultra-Fast Generation (`generateJournalPDFUltraFast`)

Minimal formatting for maximum speed:
- A4 format in millimeters
- Simple text layout only
- No complex styling
- Faster file generation

## How to Access the Journal

### From UI (ReadingSummaryCard)

1. **Trigger**: Click "üîÆ End Reading" button
2. **Modal Opens**: ReadingSummaryCard appears
3. **Action**: Click "Generate Journal" button
4. **Process**:
   ```typescript
   const handleGenerateJournal = async () => {
     const entry = await onGenerateJournal(); // Calls ChatClient's generateJournalEntry()
     setJournalEntry(entry);
     setShowJournal(true);
   };
   ```
5. **Result**: PDF downloads automatically with filename:
   ```
   raven-journal-[sessionId]-[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf
   ```

### From Code

```typescript
import { generateJournalPDFFast } from '../lib/fast-pdf-generator';

// Generate journal for current session
const result = await generateJournalPDFFast(
  journalEntry,        // { title, narrative, metadata }
  sessionId,           // Current session ID
  'conversational'     // 'technical' or 'conversational'
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log('PDF generated!');
} else {
  console.error('Failed:', result.message);
}
```

---

## Data Sources

### Session Context (ChatClient.tsx)

```typescript
const [sessionContext, setSessionContext] = useState({
  sessionStart: Date.now(),
  actorProfile: null,
  wbHits: [],          // "yes" responses
  abeHits: [],         // "maybe" responses  
  osrMisses: [],       // "no"/"unclear" responses
  actorWeighting: 0,
  roleWeighting: 0,
  driftIndex: 0,
  currentComposite: undefined,
  sessionActive: true
});
```

### Message History

```typescript
// Last 12 messages used for conversation paraphrase
const recent = messages.slice(-12);
const userLines = recent.filter(m => m.role === "user" && !m.isReport);
const ravenLines = recent.filter(m => m.role === "raven");
```

### PingTracker Data

```typescript
// Session stats from feedback tracking
const stats = pingTracker.getHitRateStats(true); // sessionOnly=true
const patterns = pingTracker.getSessionPatterns(sessionId);
```

## Use Cases

### 1. **Personal Archive**

User wants to save the reading for later reflection:
- Downloads PDF after session
- Reviews patterns when they recur
- Tracks resonance accuracy over time

### 2. **Sharing with Others**

User wants to discuss the reading:
- Sends PDF to therapist/coach
- Shares with partner (relationship readings)
- Posts excerpts in astro communities

### 3. **Comparison Analysis**

User wants to track pattern evolution:
- Downloads after each session
- Compares Actor/Role composites
- Watches drift index changes

### 4. **AI Input (Future)**

PDF could be uploaded back to Poetic Brain:
- "Here's my last reading..."
- Raven references previous patterns
- Continuity across sessions

## Technical Details

### File Size

- **Typical**: 50-150 KB (compressed PDF)
- **Fast generation**: jsPDF bypasses HTML rendering
- **No images**: Pure text content for speed

### Browser Compatibility

- Works in all modern browsers
- Uses dynamic import: `const { jsPDF } = await import('jspdf')`
- Falls back gracefully if PDF generation fails

### Storage

- **NOT saved to localStorage**: Too large
- **Downloads only**: User manages files
- **No server storage**: Privacy-first approach

## Troubleshooting

### "PDF generation failed"

**Causes:**
- Browser doesn't support jsPDF
- Insufficient memory (huge session)
- Content has invalid characters

**Solutions:**
1. Try "Ultra Fast" mode (simpler layout)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Use smaller session (end reading sooner)
4. Export as JSON instead

### "Nothing downloaded"

**Causes:**
- Pop-up blocker
- Download permissions
- Browser security settings

**Solutions:**
1. Allow downloads from site
2. Check browser's download settings
3. Try different browser

### "Content looks weird"

**Causes:**
- Special characters in narrative
- Very long unbroken words
- Emoji rendering issues

**Solutions:**
1. Use text sanitization
2. Check `stripHtml()` function
3. Report as bug with sample

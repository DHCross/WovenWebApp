Here’s the plan in plain language: start with a 3–4 day cleanup sprint focused on QA—fix the six failing tests, rerun the golden-standard check, and wire in the privacy guard so exports stay safe. With that foundation, spend 2–3 days tightening type safety, leaning on the existing TypeScript/Zod scaffolding to protect the critical API inputs. Next, dedicate 4–6 days to developer experience—add lint scripts, polish docs, and streamline the workflows so future passes are faster. Finish with a 3–4 day monitoring pass to wire up the key metrics and alerting you need. Altogether that’s roughly 12–17 days of steady work (a bit less if you blitz)

## [2025-11-16] Poetic Brain Reading stack + Symbolic Weather export repair

**Date:** 2025-11-16  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact:** HIGH – Clarifies Poetic Brain Reading vs. Symbolic Weather and restores usable FIELD data for exports

**What changed**
- **UI vocabulary: Poetic Brain Reading ↔ Symbolic Weather / FIELD**
  - Updated Math Brain frontstage labels so the three-layer stack is explicit:
    - MAP = natal chart / constitutional geometry.
    - Symbolic Weather / FIELD = dynamic pressure metrics (magnitude, directional bias, coherence).
    - Poetic Brain Reading = Raven's narrative built from MAP + Symbolic Weather.
  - Reintroduced "Symbolic Weather" where the UI is clearly talking about raw FIELD data (transits config, snapshot card, FIELD scatter plots), while reserving "Poetic Brain Reading" for narrative/log surfaces and dashboards.
  - Clarified copy in the Unified dashboard, Weather plots, snapshot, and graphs download so users see that their Poetic Brain Reading is explicitly "reading from" the Symbolic Weather / FIELD layer.

- **Math Brain v2: Symbolic Weather export pipeline fixed**
  - Patched `app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts` so `unified_output.woven_map.symbolic_weather` is synthesized from `daily_entries.symbolic_weather` (creating `meter.mag_x10` / `meter.bias_x10` per day) instead of assuming `unifiedOutput.transits` is a keyed object.
  - Kept a fallback: if v2 daily entries are missing but legacy `chartData.woven_map.symbolic_weather` exists, the route still forwards that data.
  - Updated the Poetic Brain adapter (`lib/poetic-brain-adapter.ts`) to fall back to root-level `daily_readings` when `symbolic_weather_context.daily_readings` is absent, so Poetic Brain can still build hooks and climate lines from existing FIELD metrics.
  - As a result, new `mirror-symbolic-weather` JSON exports now contain non-empty `symbolic_weather_context` entries with real dates and FIELD meters, instead of null shells.

**Why it matters**
- Makes the epistemic contract visible in the product: users can see the difference between MAP (geometry), Symbolic Weather (FIELD), and Poetic Brain Reading (interpretation), rather than treating "weather" as a vague synonym for "reading".
- Restores a usable FIELD layer for downstream tools and Poetic Brain, closing the gap where `symbolic_weather_context` existed structurally but carried no transit geometry.
- Aligns the external Poetic Brain payload (`symbolic_weather_context`) with the internal Math Brain v2 `daily_entries` data, reducing the chance of future regressions when the seismograph/field engines evolve.

**Files Changed / Added**
- UI / frontstage:
  - `app/math-brain/page.tsx`
  - `app/math-brain/components/SnapshotDisplay.tsx`
  - `app/math-brain/components/DownloadControls.tsx`
  - `components/mathbrain/UnifiedSymbolicDashboard.tsx`
  - `components/mathbrain/WeatherPlots.tsx`
- Engine / export:
  - `app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts`
  - `lib/export/mirrorSymbolicWeather.ts` (read-path only; now fed with richer data)
  - `lib/poetic-brain-adapter.ts`

**Testing & Verification**
- Ran a daily transit report through Math Brain v2 from the UI, then:
  - Downloaded the Mirror+Symbolic Weather JSON and verified `symbolic_weather_context` contains one entry per date with non-null `meter.mag_x10` / `meter.bias_x10`.
  - Confirmed that Poetic Brain payloads can still be validated and that the adapter sees daily FIELD metrics via either `symbolic_weather_context.daily_readings` or root `daily_readings`.
- Manually sanity-checked the Math Brain frontstage UI for:
  - Clear separation of MAP vs. Symbolic Weather vs. Poetic Brain Reading.
  - No regressions in Balance Meter visuals or snapshot cards.

**Next Steps**
1. Gradually populate `as`, `tpos`, and `thouse` in `symbolic_weather_context` from the seismograph/transit tables, so the FIELD map fully matches the spec (not just meters).
2. Add a short, user-facing tooltip or help card that summarizes the MAP → Symbolic Weather / FIELD → Poetic Brain Reading stack in one place.
3. Once FIELD map completeness is stable, consider adding light automated tests around `woven_map.symbolic_weather` shape to prevent regressions.

## [2025-11-15] Velocity tracker guardrails + telemetry refresh

**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact:** MEDIUM – keeps collaboration telemetry trustworthy as we prep to re-home the toolkit

**What changed**
- **Notifier hardening**
  - `scripts/velocity-notifier.js` now respects `VELOCITY_LOG_PATH` / `VELOCITY_LOG_MIRROR_PATH`, falling back to `.logs/velocity-log.jsonl` so every component watches the same ledger.
  - Added a divide-by-zero guard in `detectSignificantChange()` so zero-velocity baselines no longer blow up percentage math when the previous run logged 0 commits/hour.
- **Synergy log bootstrap**
  - `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` now auto-creates `.logs/debug-session.jsonl` (with a one-time console hint) before reading signals, ensuring the synergy dashboard never reports "no signals" just because the log file was missing.
- **Telemetry refresh**
  - Re-ran `npm run velocity:run -- --force-local` followed by `npm run velocity:report` inside the primary repo to seed the latest Math Brain cadence, regenerate `docs/velocity-forecast.md`, and update `velocity-artifacts/velocity-summary.json` plus `.logs/velocity-log.jsonl`.

**Why it matters**
- These fixes close the gaps flagged by the velocity toolkit staging repo so we can safely transplant `tools/velocity/` back into the Electron Markdown Book App without shipping brittle guards.
- Auto-bootstrapping the debug signal log keeps the AI synergy metrics honest—operators immediately see zero real signals instead of silent file-not-found failures.
- The fresh telemetry snapshot provides a verifiable baseline for the receiving repo (and for our own records) before we hand off the toolkit.

**Files Changed / Added**
- `scripts/velocity-notifier.js`
- `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js`
- Regenerated artifacts/logs:
  - `.logs/velocity-log.jsonl`
  - `docs/velocity-forecast.md`
  - `velocity-artifacts/velocity-summary.json`

**Next Steps**
1. Port `tools/velocity/` (with these fixes) into the Electron Markdown Book App and re-run the telemetry seeding commands there.
2. Capture the cross-repo integration details in that repo’s changelog or PR body so stakeholders have provenance for the new guardrails.
3. If the host repo is shared/third-party, open an issue describing the notifier/log fixes plus the synergy bootstrap requirement so future contributors can trace the context.

## [2025-11-13] FIX: Math Brain v2 unified output + Velocity synergies

**Date:** 2025-11-13  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED  
**Impact:** HIGH – Restores production report generation and enriches velocity/synergy telemetry

**What changed**
- **Math Brain v2 resiliency**
  - Patched `runMathBrain()` so `run_metadata` is created once and shared across the unified payload, preventing `relationship_context` assignments from hitting `undefined` (@src/math_brain/main.js).
  - Derived root-level `mirror_data` from the most recent `daily_entries` record (`latestMirrorData`) to honor Guardrail 1.C and stop Netlify from throwing `ReferenceError: mirrorData is not defined`.
- **Velocity & synergy instrumentation**
  - `scripts/debug-signal.js` now accepts `--signal_type` (with npm shortcuts `debug:success` / `debug:failure`) so every debug entry is auto-tagged for AI-assisted fix tracking.
  - Expanded `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` to ingest `.logs/debug-session.jsonl`, compute AI synergy ratios (fix vs. regression counts, failures/hour, net-synergy velocity), and surface them in both `docs/velocity-forecast.md` and `velocity-artifacts/velocity-summary.json`.
  - Grouped velocity scripts in `package.json` (`velocity`, `velocity:all`, `velocity:provenance`) to keep analytics invocations consistent.

**Why it matters**
- Production previously failed with `Math Brain v2 processing failed` whenever `relationship_context` was missing; the fix reestablishes ACC Spec v2 compliance and restores report generation at https://ravencalder.com.
- Synergy instrumentation now quantifies whether AI-assisted fixes outpace AI-induced regressions, giving empirical velocity + quality metrics for future retros.

**Files Changed / Added**
- `src/math_brain/main.js`
- `scripts/debug-signal.js`
- `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js`
- `package.json`
- Regenerated artifacts: `docs/velocity-forecast.md`, `velocity-artifacts/velocity-summary.json`

**Testing & Deployment**
- `npm run build`
- `netlify deploy --prod` → https://ravencalder.com (deploy id `69168940f30b3911a59d97b0`)
- Manual verification: Generated Math Brain report (Mirror) succeeds, synergy section renders with zero baseline pending future signals.

**Next Steps**
1. Start logging real `debug:success` / `debug:failure` events so the synergy dashboard reflects live AI collaboration data.
2. Automate `velocity:all` in CI to publish updated Markdown/JSON after meaningful merges.
3. Monitor Netlify logs for any additional Math Brain edge cases (e.g., Foundation mode) and add regression tests once stabilized.

## [2025-11-11] FEATURE: Collaboration Velocity Instrumentation (artifacts + thesis)

**Date:** 2025-11-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact:** MEDIUM – Adds project-level telemetry artifacts and scripts; no runtime changes

**What changed**
- Added a deterministic velocity artifacts generator that converts JSONL telemetry into a Markdown forecast:
   - `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` reads `.logs/velocity-log.jsonl` and writes `docs/velocity-forecast.md`
   - Gracefully degrades when the ledger is empty or missing (emits a helpful placeholder)
- Captured the meta-product recognition and extraction plan:
   - `docs/VELOCITY_PRODUCT_THESIS_2025-11-11.md` (thesis + provenance)
   - `docs/velocity-product/README.md` (standalone product framing + roadmap)
- NPM scripts for easy invocation:
   - `velocity:forecast`, `velocity:artifacts`, `velocity:notify` (kept existing `velocity:*` aliases)
- Generated the initial artifact snapshot: `docs/velocity-forecast.md`

**Why it matters**
- Establishes a reproducible, documented signal for Human–AI collaboration velocity (commits/interactions/merge cadence)
- Moves maintenance toward deterministic automation with provenance artifacts
- Lays groundwork to replace brittle source-text CI gates with runtime assertions and telemetry-informed checks
- Frames “Velocity Instrumentation” as a meta-product with a clear extraction path, keeping this repo lean

**Files Changed / Added**
- `scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` – new generator (JSONL → Markdown)
- `docs/velocity-forecast.md` – generated snapshot (auto-updated by script)
- `docs/VELOCITY_PRODUCT_THESIS_2025-11-11.md` – thesis and rationale
- `docs/velocity-product/README.md` – product scaffold and roadmap
- `package.json` – ensured `velocity:forecast` and companion scripts are available

**Testing & Verification**
- Ran `npm run velocity:forecast` locally:
   - ✅ Creates/updates `docs/velocity-forecast.md`
   - ✅ Emits placeholder narrative when `.logs/velocity-log.jsonl` is missing or sparse
   - ✅ Does not touch runtime code paths

**Next Steps**
1. CI wiring: add a post-merge job to run `velocity:forecast` and publish the artifact; gate commits to avoid noisy diffs (time/size threshold or scheduled run)
2. Telemetry enrichment: extend JSONL event schema (commit SHA, PR merge markers, interaction classes) to produce meaningful rolling stats
3. Replace brittle CI gates: migrate to runtime invariants (spec version, pipeline, numeric ranges) and associated tests; retire legacy seismograph only after migration
4. Evaluate extraction of the velocity instrumentation into a standalone repo when stable

## [2025-11-11] UPDATE: Comprehensive Copilot Instructions

**Date:** 2025-11-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact:** MEDIUM – Improves AI-assisted development quality and consistency

**What changed**
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with comprehensive project documentation:
  - Added Project Snapshot section with stack details (Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind)
  - Expanded Coding Conventions with TypeScript, React, and terminology guidelines
  - Enhanced Architecture Overview with detailed component descriptions

  - Added Serverless Functions Instructions section with validation, error handling, and testing guidelines
  - Added Frontend Instructions section with React/Next.js best practices, styling, and accessibility guidelines
  - Retained all existing sections on deployment, troubleshooting, and quick reference commands

**Why it matters**
- Provides clear, comprehensive guidance for AI assistants working on the codebase
- Ensures consistency in code style, terminology, and architecture decisions
- Documents privacy constraints (Dan/Stephie names) and voice guidelines (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)
- References key documentation for deeper context (Four Report Types, Raven Persona, etc.)
- Reduces likelihood of AI-introduced bugs by specifying validation patterns and error handling

**Files Changed**
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` – comprehensive update with project guidelines

**References**

## [2025-11-10] Math Brain now persists nation for both subjects

**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** HIGH – prevents false "Birth data invalid" errors when reusing saved configs or exports

**What changed**
- Added `nation` to the Math Brain `Subject` type so both Person A and Person B always store the country used for API calls.
- Default Person A/B state now seeds `nation: "US"` (matching previous implicit assumption) but allows the user to override it.
- Payload builder, session persistence, and chunked requests now forward the stored nation instead of hard-coding one-off defaults.

**Why it matters**
- RapidAPI v4 rejects requests lacking `city + nation`; previously we only injected "US" at request time. When configs were exported/imported (e.g., `math_brain_setup_*.json`), the nation field was lost, producing validation failures on rerun.
- Persisting the nation alongside other birth details keeps saved setups, session resumes, and replayed JSON inputs API-compliant without extra manual edits.

**Files Changed**
- `app/math-brain/types.ts` – added optional `nation` to `Subject` type definition.
- `app/math-brain/page.tsx` – defaulted nation for both subjects, ensured payload/session logic forwards stored values.
- `analysis/math_brain_setup_A_20251110T070438.json` – updated reference setup to include `"nation": "US"`.

**Testing**
- Manual verification: reran Math Brain with saved setup; route accepted payload and produced report without birth-data validation errors.

## [2025-11-09] CRITICAL FIX: RapidAPI v4 Requires City+Nation Even With Coordinates

**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Production API returning 503 "Unable to retrieve natal chart data"

**Production Symptoms**
- Math Brain API consistently returned HTTP 503 with error code `UPSTREAM_TEMPORARY`
- Error detail: "Unable to retrieve natal chart data from upstream service"
- Local testing revealed RapidAPI v4 was rejecting requests with validation errors
- API key was valid and subscription active

**Root Cause Analysis**
RapidAPI Astrologer API v4 **requires `city` and `nation` fields even when coordinates (lat/lon/tz) are provided**. The coordinate fallback path in `src/math-brain/api-client.js` was omitting these fields, causing upstream validation failures.

**API Behavior Discovery**
```bash
# Without city - FAILS with validation error
curl -X POST 'https://astrologer.p.rapidapi.com/api/v4/birth-chart' \
  -d '{"subject":{"name":"Dan","year":1973,"month":7,"day":24,"hour":14,"minute":30,
       "latitude":40.0167,"longitude":-75.3,"timezone":"America/New_York","zodiac_type":"Tropic"}}'
# Response: {"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","subject","city"],"msg":"Field required"}]}

# With city+nation - SUCCESS
curl -X POST 'https://astrologer.p.rapidapi.com/api/v4/birth-chart' \
  -d '{"subject":{"name":"Dan","year":1973,"month":7,"day":24,"hour":14,"minute":30,
       "city":"Bryn Mawr","nation":"US","latitude":40.0167,"longitude":-75.3,
       "timezone":"America/New_York","zodiac_type":"Tropic"}}'
# Response: {"status":"OK", ...complete birth chart...}
```

**The Fix**
Updated `callNatal()` coordinate fallback path to always include city+nation when available:

```javascript
// BEFORE (line 70):
const payloadCoords = { subject: subjectToAPI(subject, { 
  ...pass, 
  require_city: canTryCity,  // ← Only if city exists
  force_city_mode: false, 
  suppress_coords: false, 
  suppress_geonames: true 
}) };

// AFTER:
// CRITICAL: RapidAPI v4 requires city+nation even when coordinates are provided
const payloadCoords = { subject: subjectToAPI(subject, { 
  ...pass, 
  require_city: true,  // ← Always include city if available
  force_city_mode: false, 
  suppress_coords: false, 
  suppress_geonames: true 
}) };
```

**Alignment with API Documentation**
This fix aligns with documented API requirements from `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`:
- "All Math Brain API requests must include a valid IANA timezone string"
- Expected payload format requires: `name, year, month, day, hour, minute, city, nation, latitude, longitude, timezone`

**Files Changed**
- `src/math-brain/api-client.js` - Updated coordinate fallback to require city+nation

**Testing**
- ✅ Local test with `subjectToAPI()` confirms city+nation included in coordinate mode
- ✅ Direct RapidAPI curl test with benchmark payload succeeds
- ⏳ Netlify production deployment in progress

**Impact**
- **Before:** 100% failure rate on Generate Report (503 errors)
- **After:** Natal chart fetch succeeds with complete geometry
- **User Impact:** Restores full Math Brain functionality

## [2025-11-09] CRITICAL FIX: Multiple Circular Dependencies Causing Production 503 Errors

**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (superseded by RapidAPI v4 city+nation fix above)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Production 503 errors on ALL astrology-mathbrain API requests

**Production Symptoms**
- Users reported consistent 503 "Astrologer API is temporarily unavailable" errors
- Generate Report button failed 100% of the time
- Last several Netlify deployments succeeded but runtime crashed
- RapidAPI subscription was active (ULTRA plan, only 2.96% usage) - service was working fine

**Root Cause Analysis**
Three critical circular dependency issues introduced during Math Brain refactoring:

1. **validation.js circular dependency** (Commit 311c4c2)
   - `validation.js` imported `logger` from `astrology-mathbrain.js`
   - `astrology-mathbrain.js` imported `validation.js` via orchestrator
   - Result: `logger` was `undefined` during module initialization
   - All validation calls crashed with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'info')"

2. **seismograph-engine.js circular dependency** (Commit 3b8ded8)
   - `seismograph-engine.js` imported 13+ functions/constants from monolith at load time
   - Monolith imported seismograph-engine via orchestrator
   - Result: Functions were `undefined`, causing seismograph calculations to fail
   - Node.js warnings: "Accessing non-existent property of module exports inside circular dependency"

3. **TypeScript build failures** (Commit 4f2f888)
   - `astrology-health/route.ts` imported non-existent `health` function
   - `ChatClient.tsx` used `resumeFlashToken` before declaration (hoisting issue)
   - `browserslist` database outdated
   - Result: Builds failed at TypeScript compilation, blocking all deployments

**Why This Was Hard to Diagnose**
- **Production masking:** Webpack/Next.js sometimes cached dependency graphs, making failures intermittent
- **Misleading errors:** 503 responses said "Astrologer API temporarily unavailable" but it was our code failing
- **Dev environment differences:** Node.js dev server resolved dependencies differently, sometimes working locally
- **Race conditions:** Module initialization order varied between builds

**The Fixes**

**Fix 1: validation.js (Commit 311c4c2)**
```javascript
// BEFORE (circular):
const { parseCoordinates, logger } = require('../../lib/server/astrology-mathbrain');
const { normalizeTimezone } = require('./utils/time-and-coords');

// AFTER (clean):
const { normalizeTimezone, logger, parseCoordinates } = require('./utils/time-and-coords');
```
- Consolidated all imports to use `time-and-coords.js` directly
- Broke the circular dependency chain
- All utilities properly exported from single source

**Fix 2: seismograph-engine.js (Commit 3b8ded8)**
```javascript
// Implemented lazy-loading pattern to defer monolith imports
function getLazyImports() {
  if (!enrichDailyAspectsLazy) {
    const monolith = require('../../lib/server/astrology-mathbrain');
    // Load all dependencies AFTER module initialization completes
    enrichDailyAspectsLazy = monolith.enrichDailyAspects;
    // ... etc
  }
  return { enrichDailyAspects, selectPoeticAspects, ... };
}
```
- Moved seismograph/metric imports to proper module locations:
  - `aggregate`, `seismoInternals` from `src/seismograph.js`
  - `classifyMagnitude`, `classifyDirectionalBias`, etc. from `lib/reporting/metric-labels`
- Deferred monolith imports using lazy-loading pattern
- Functions called via `getLazyImports()` only when needed

**Fix 3: TypeScript Build Errors (Commit 4f2f888)**
- **astrology-health/route.ts:** Replaced non-existent import with simple health check implementation
- **ChatClient.tsx:** Moved `resumeFlashToken` useEffect after `useFileUpload` hook call
- **package-lock.json:** Updated caniuse-lite from 1.0.30001741 to 1.0.30001754

**Verification**
```bash
# No circular dependency warnings
$ node -e "require('./lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js')"
✅ Module loads
Handler: function
(NO WARNINGS!)

# TypeScript compilation succeeds
$ npx tsc --noEmit
✅ (no output = success)
```

**Files Changed**
- `src/math-brain/validation.js` - Fixed circular import
- `src/math-brain/seismograph-engine.js` - Implemented lazy-loading pattern
- `app/api/astrology-health/route.ts` - Fixed non-existent import
- `components/ChatClient.tsx` - Fixed variable hoisting
- `package-lock.json` - Updated browserslist database
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete documentation
- `Lessons Learned for Developer.md` - Added circular dependency prevention guide

**Testing**
- ✅ All modules load without circular dependency warnings
- ✅ TypeScript compiles cleanly
- ✅ Dev server handles API requests successfully
- ✅ Production deployment succeeds
- ✅ API requests complete without 503 errors

**Lessons Learned**
1. **Audit all imports during refactoring** - Circular dependencies can be silent killers
2. **Use lazy-loading for cross-dependencies** - Defer imports until after module initialization
3. **Test with `node --trace-warnings`** - Catches circular dependencies early
4. **Production can mask issues** - Build-time caching hides module initialization problems
5. **503 errors aren't always upstream** - Check for circular dependencies first

**Deployment Impact**
- **Before:** 100% failure rate on Generate Report
- **After:** Reports generate successfully
- **RapidAPI:** Was never the problem - subscription active and working
- **User Impact:** Restored full functionality to production site

## [2025-11-09] CRITICAL FIX: Circular Dependency in Validation Module

**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Superseded by comprehensive fix above)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Broke all local API requests with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'info')"

**Note:** This was the first circular dependency discovered. See entry above for complete analysis of all three circular dependency issues found and fixed on 2025-11-09.

**Root Cause**
- `src/math-brain/validation.js` was importing `logger` from `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js`
- This created a circular dependency: `astrology-mathbrain.js` → `orchestrator.js` → `validation.js` → `astrology-mathbrain.js`
- During module initialization, `logger` was `undefined`, causing validation to crash on every request
- Production worked because it uses compiled/cached modules; dev environment exposed the issue

**The Fix**
- Consolidated imports in `validation.js` to use `time-and-coords.js` as single source:
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE (circular):
  const { parseCoordinates, logger } = require('../../lib/server/astrology-mathbrain');
  const { normalizeTimezone } = require('./utils/time-and-coords');
  
  // AFTER (clean):
  const { normalizeTimezone, logger, parseCoordinates } = require('./utils/time-and-coords');
  ```
- All three utilities are properly exported from `time-and-coords.js`, breaking the cycle

**Lesson**
- **Always check import paths during refactoring** - circular dependencies can be silent in production but fatal in dev
- When extracting modules, audit all imports to ensure they flow in one direction
- If a module imports from a file that imports it back (even indirectly), you have a cycle
- Use the orchestrator pattern correctly: modules should import FROM orchestrator, never create cycles THROUGH it

**Files Changed**
- `src/math-brain/validation.js` - Fixed import statement

**Testing**
- ✅ Dev server now handles API requests without crashes
- ✅ Validation module loads cleanly
- ✅ No circular dependency warnings

## [2025-11-09] FEATURE: Math Brain Refactoring and Comparison Tools

**Date:** 2025-11-09  Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  Completed modular refactoring of Math Brain system and created automated comparison tools for validation.

**Details**

  - **Math Brain Modularization:** Broke down the monolithic astrology-mathbrain.js into smaller, focused modules for better maintainability and testing.
  - **Comparison Script Creation:** Developed automated scripts to compare outputs between old and new implementations, ensuring accuracy during refactoring.
  - **Clear Mirror Integration:** Implemented unified rendering contracts for consistent output formatting across all report types.
  - **Documentation Updates:** Updated CHANGELOG.md and related documentation to reflect all recent architectural improvements.
  - **Testing Integration:** Enhanced test coverage with new validation scripts and improved error handling patterns.

## [2025-10-10] NOTE: Development Environment Reminder

**Date:** 2025-10-10  Summary

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED  Documented the recommended local workflow so everyone keeps Netlify auth, proxies, and functions aligned.

**Details**

  - `netlify dev` should be the default local runner because it mirrors production: the Next.js frontend runs on `http://localhost:8888`, Netlify Functions are auto-proxied under `/.netlify/functions/*`, and Auth0 callbacks stay aligned with the saved `http://localhost:8888` origin.
  - The plain `npm run dev`/`next dev` server lands on `http://localhost:3000` and bypasses the proxy, so OAuth callbacks break and serverless APIs disappear unless a separate functions runner or proxy is wired up.
- Keeping `netlify dev` in the loop keeps Poetic Brain flows, Auth0, and any other Netlify-backed routes functional during development.

## [Unreleased] AUTH: Dev Auth0 Reminder

**Date:** 2025-11-08  Summary

**Status:** ⚠️ CONFIGURATION  Clarified that running locally still requires the dev Auth0 tenant entries and explained how / when to change them.

**Details**

  - Your local `.env` needs the Auth0 values `AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-z8gw1uk6zgsrzubk.us.auth0.com`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=0nV0L41xZijfc8HTKtoROPgyqgMttJYT`, and `AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://ravencalder-api` so RavenCalder can authenticate against the dev tenant.
  - The audience string comes from the Auth0 API identifier and is effectively locked once created, so keep `https://ravencalder-api` unless you delete that API and recreate it with a different identifier.
  - If you opt to change the identifier, note that Auth0 won’t let you edit it later; you must delete the API and re-run the Create API flow before updating `.env`.

## [2025-11-09] FIX: Math Brain Phase 2 Tail Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-11-09  Summary

**Status:** ✅ STABILIZED  Finished the API-client extraction for `getTransits` by deleting the orphaned legacy code and re-validating the monolith load.

**Build:** ✅ `node -e "require('./lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js')"` now exits cleanly.

**Details**

- `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js`
  - Removed the leftover inline `getTransits` implementation (and its `ensureCoords` helper) that still lived between `validateSubjectStrictWithMap` and `exports.resolveCity`, so the monolith only imports the API-client version.
  - Ensured `subjectToAPI`, `getTransits`, and `geoResolve` are exclusively sourced from `src/math-brain/api-client.js`, preventing duplicate logic.
  - Fixed the missing `);` after the synastry `apiCallWithRetry` call once the duplicate block was removed, resolving the `Unexpected token 'const'/'catch'` errors on require.
  - Re-ran `node -e "require('./lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js'); console.log('monolith loaded');"` to confirm the handler loads without syntax faults.

## [2025-01-21] FEATURE: Clear Mirror Unified Rendering Schema


**Date:** 2025-01-21  Summary

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE  Implemented comprehensive unified rendering contract between Raven auto-execution (LLM output) and Clear Mirror template (PDF/export rendering). The LLM now emits structured sections with explicit headings (Hook Stack, Frontstage, Polarity Cards, Mirror Voice, Socratic Closure) that map directly to the Clear Mirror template, ensuring consistent structure across all export formats.

**Build:** ✅ PASSING

Implementation

---A. Auto-Execution Prompts (app/api/raven/route.ts)

   - Updated all four execution modes with Clear Mirror structure requirements:

## What Was Implemented     * relational_auto (lines 487-503): Structured prompts for relational mirrors

     * parallel_auto (lines 505-519): Separate mirrors for A and B with shared closure

You asked to "extend the Clear Mirror template with richer section schema and update the Raven auto-execution prompt to emit these sections explicitly." This creates a **unified rendering contract** where the LLM and template stay perfectly synchronized.     * contextual_auto (lines 551-562): Context-layer integration with Clear Mirror sections

     * solo_auto (lines 567-579): Solo mirror with explicit section headings

### The Contract   - Each mode now instructs LLM to generate:

     1. Hook Stack (4 items): Numbered, bolded headlines with inline geometry footnotes

**LLM Always Emits:**     2. Frontstage: FIELD LAYER coordinates (date/time/location), planetary geometry summary

1. **Hook Stack** (4 items) - Top-loaded high-charge aspects     3. Polarity Cards (2-4): Tension/contradiction pairs with titles

2. **Frontstage** - FIELD LAYER coordinates and geometry     4. Mirror Voice: VOICE LAYER narrative with embedded Socratic question

3. **Polarity Cards** (2-4) - Tension/contradiction pairs       5. Socratic Closure: Optional custom reflection or standard closure

4. **Mirror Voice** - VOICE LAYER narrative with Socratic question

5. **Socratic Closure** - Optional custom text + marking guideB. Response Parser (lib/raven/clear-mirror-parser.ts)

   - Created new parser module to extract structured sections from LLM markdown output

**Template Always Renders:**   - Exports:

- All LLM sections (when present)     * parseClearMirrorResponse(markdown): Extracts Hook Stack, Frontstage, Polarity Cards, Mirror Voice, Socratic Closure

- **Session Validation Layer** (Actor/Role + stats + rubric)     * hasValidClearMirrorStructure(parsed): Validates presence of required sections

- Fallback to template placeholders if LLM structure missing   - Regex-based extraction for each section type:

     * Hook Stack: `**1. [Headline]** body` pattern

---     * Frontstage: `### Frontstage` → text until next section

     * Polarity Cards: `**Card Title**\nbody` pattern

## Files Changed     * Mirror Voice: `### Mirror Voice` → narrative content

     * Socratic Closure: `### Socratic Closure` → closure text

### 1. Auto-Execution Prompts (`app/api/raven/route.ts`)   - Falls back to rawMarkdown if parsing fails



**Updated all four execution modes:**C. Context Adapter Updates (lib/pdf/clear-mirror-context-adapter.ts)

   - Imported clear-mirror-parser for LLM response parsing

```typescript   - Updated buildClearMirrorFromContexts() to attempt structured parsing first

// ✅ relational_auto (lines 487-503)   - Added buildFromStructuredResponse() function:

// ✅ parallel_auto (lines 505-519)      * Maps parsed sections to ClearMirrorData interface

// ✅ contextual_auto (lines 551-562)     * hookStack: parser's 'body' → template's 'livedExample'

// ✅ solo_auto (lines 567-579)     * frontstage: parsed text with empty footnotes array

     * polarityCards: title + body mapping

instructions: [     * mirrorVoice: narrative text with footnotes

  'AUTO-EXECUTION: [Mode description]',     * socraticClosure: {text, includeMarkingGuide: true}

  'STRUCTURE: Generate Clear Mirror format with explicit sections:',     * sessionDiagnostics: passed through from WrapUpCard

  '1. Hook Stack (4 items): Numbered, bolded headlines with inline geometry footnotes',   - Falls back to buildFromTemplate() if structure invalid (legacy compatibility)

  '2. Frontstage: FIELD LAYER coordinates (date/time/location), planetary geometry summary',

  '3. Polarity Cards (2-4): Tension/contradiction pairs with titles',D. Template Updates (lib/templates/clear-mirror-template.ts)

  '4. Mirror Voice: VOICE LAYER narrative with embedded Socratic question',   - Already supports Hook Stack rendering (previous implementation)

  '5. Socratic Closure: Optional custom reflection or standard closure',   - Already supports Session Validation Layer (session diagnostics)

  'Execute immediately. Use section headings (### Hook Stack, etc.). E-Prime language throughout.',   - No changes needed (template-side ready for structured input)

]

```E. Prompt Architecture (lib/prompts/clear-mirror-auto-execution.ts)

   - Created comprehensive prompt architecture document (200+ lines)

**What this does:** Instructs Perplexity to generate structured markdown with section headings that the parser can extract.   - Exports:

     * CLEAR_MIRROR_AUTO_EXECUTION_PROMPT: Multi-section structure guide with examples

---     * CLEAR_MIRROR_STRUCTURE_HINTS: Section descriptions

     * GEOMETRY_FOOTNOTE_FORMAT: Formatting specifications

### 2. Response Parser (`lib/raven/clear-mirror-parser.ts`) - NEW     * EXAMPLE_HOOKS: 4 sample hook items

   - Defines exact output format for each section

**150+ lines, exports:**   - Includes formatting rules: section headings (###), numbered items, inline footnotes



```typescriptF. Documentation (CLEAR_MIRROR_UNIFIED_SCHEMA.md)

parseClearMirrorResponse(markdown: string) → ParsedClearMirrorSections   - Created comprehensive schema documentation (400+ lines)

hasValidClearMirrorStructure(parsed) → boolean   - Architecture overview: 5 components (prompts, parser, adapter, template, diagnostics)

```   - Complete data flow diagram (upload → LLM → parsing → PDF)

   - Section specifications with format examples

**What it extracts:**   - Validation & fallback logic

- Hook Stack items: `**1. [Headline]** body text¹²³`   - Testing procedures

- Frontstage section: Everything between `### Frontstage` and next section   - Maintenance guidelines

- Polarity Cards: `**Card Title**\nbody text`   - Future export format support (HTML email, share cards)

- Mirror Voice: Narrative from `### Mirror Voice`

- Socratic Closure: Text from `### Socratic Closure`Architecture Benefits

1. **Consistent LLM Output:** All auto-execution modes emit identical structure

**Validation:** Requires Hook Stack, Frontstage, and Mirror Voice for validity.2. **Predictable Parsing:** Regex-based extraction from markdown with validation

3. **Template Compatibility:** Single ClearMirrorData payload serves PDF, HTML, JSON

---4. **Session Diagnostics Integration:** Actor/Role composite, resonance stats, rubric scores

5. **Fallback Support:** Legacy template path for unstructured responses

### 3. Context Adapter (`lib/pdf/clear-mirror-context-adapter.ts`)6. **Future-Proof:** Schema supports HTML email, share cards, API exports



**Updated `buildClearMirrorFromContexts()` flow:**Validation

- Build: ✅ PASS (npm run build successful)

```typescript- TypeScript: ✅ PASS (all type errors resolved)

1. Parse LLM response: parseClearMirrorResponse(contexts[0].content)- Structure: ✅ All auto-execution modes updated with consistent prompts

2. Validate structure: hasValidClearMirrorStructure(parsed)- Parser: ✅ Created with validation and fallback logic

3. If valid → buildFromStructuredResponse() (maps sections to ClearMirrorData)- Adapter: ✅ Maps parsed sections to ClearMirrorData interface

4. Else → buildFromTemplate() (legacy fallback with placeholders)- Documentation: ✅ Comprehensive schema guide created

```

Data Flow

**Mapping logic:**```

- `parsed.hookStack` → `data.hookStack` (headline + livedExample)1. User uploads chart → Math Brain computes geometry

- `parsed.frontstage` → `data.frontstage.text`2. Poetic Brain auto-execution triggered

- `parsed.polarityCards` → `data.polarityCards` (title + text)3. LLM receives structured prompt (STRUCTURE: Generate Clear Mirror format...)

- `parsed.mirrorVoice` → `data.mirrorVoice.text`4. LLM emits markdown with section headings (### Hook Stack, ### Frontstage, etc.)

- `parsed.socraticClosure` → `data.socraticClosure.text`5. Response stored in reportContext.content

- `sessionDiagnostics` passed through from WrapUpCard6. User clicks "Export Clear Mirror" in WrapUpCard

7. WrapUpCard collects sessionDiagnostics (Actor/Role + stats + rubric)

---8. ChatClient calls buildClearMirrorFromContexts(contexts, diagnostics)

9. Adapter parses LLM response → extracts sections via regex

### 4. Prompt Architecture (`lib/prompts/clear-mirror-auto-execution.ts`) - NEW10. Adapter validates structure → builds ClearMirrorData

11. Template renders markdown → includes Session Validation Layer

**200+ lines, exports:**12. PDF generator converts markdown → downloadable PDF

```

```typescript

CLEAR_MIRROR_AUTO_EXECUTION_PROMPT  // Comprehensive structure guideTesting Requirements

CLEAR_MIRROR_STRUCTURE_HINTS        // Section descriptions- Manual: Upload chart → auto-execution → verify section headings in response

GEOMETRY_FOOTNOTE_FORMAT            // Formatting specs- Export: Complete session → WrapUpCard → export PDF → verify all sections render

EXAMPLE_HOOKS                       // 4 sample hook items- Fallback: Test with unstructured response → verify template fallback works

```- Diagnostics: Verify Session Validation Layer appears when diagnostics provided



**Purpose:** Reference document for prompt engineering. Defines exact output format, formatting rules, and examples for each section.Next Steps

- Integration testing: Full flow from upload to PDF export

---- User feedback collection: Verify section structure clarity

- Future formats: HTML email renderer, share card generator

### 5. Documentation (`CLEAR_MIRROR_UNIFIED_SCHEMA.md`) - NEW- Parser refinement: Improve regex patterns based on real LLM output



**400+ lines covering:**Files Modified

- Architecture overview (5 components)- app/api/raven/route.ts (4 auto-execution modes updated)

- Complete data flow diagram- lib/raven/clear-mirror-parser.ts (NEW: 150+ lines)

- Maintenance guidelines

- Future export format supportPhilosophy

"The LLM always emits the same headings, and the template knows exactly where to place actor/role composites, resonance stats, and rubric scores." This unified rendering contract prevents drift between narrative generation and export formatting, supports multiple export formats from a single structured payload, and integrates empirical session validation seamlessly into symbolic geometry reports.

### Hook Stack## [2025-11-01] FEATURE: Probabilistic Forecasting Micro-Protocol Integration



**1. [The Pressure Valve]** You tend to channel accumulated intensity into tangible action—work, problem-solving, creation—rather than waiting for tension to dissipate organically.¹²**Summary**

Integrated conditional probabilistic forecasting into Poetic Brain following Option C (micro-protocol with conditional trigger). Activates only for temporal/decision-window queries, providing field-sensing probability zones with optional falsifiability testing.

**2. [The Trust Sequence]** The chart indicates trust builds incrementally through demonstrated consistency rather than through verbal declaration.³

**Implementation (app/api/chat/route.ts):**

**3. [The Vulnerability Rhythm]** Emotional weather tends to alternate between warmth and withdrawal. You offer connection, then retreat when exposure feels too intense.⁴- Conditional trigger: activates when user queries involve "when", "should I", "upcoming", "future", "wait", "timing"

- Field-sensing translation of Balance Meter v5 outputs:

**4. [Motion as Medicine]** Relief arrives through channeled action—physical movement, problem-solving, creative work—rather than through passive waiting.⁵  - Compression (-2 to -5): "field feels tight/restricted"

  - Expansion (+2 to +5): "geometry leans open"

### Frontstage  - Neutral (-1 to +1): "mixed weather"

- Moderate depth: 3-4 sentence responses blending data + embodiment

Date/Time/Location: October 31, 2025, 12:00 PM, Portland, OR- Ranges, not dates: temporal zones (e.g., "through mid-month"), never fixed predictions

- Optional falsifiability: always appends "Try noting how this window lands—WB/ABE/OSR?"

Planetary geometry summary: Mars opposition Sun (0.2°), Saturn trine Neptune (1.1°), Moon square Uranus (1.2°), Jupiter trine Mercury (1.5°)

**Integration with Dual Calibration Model:**

You tend to navigate life through precision and sustained focus.¹ When external pressure accumulates, the pattern suggests channeling intensity into tangible action—work, creation, problem-solving—rather than waiting for tension to dissipate organically.²- High compression (-4 to -5) = tighter probability windows (exact-natal-resonance risk)

- Expansion (+3 to +5) = wider openness zones

### Polarity Cards- Frame as symbolic weather supporting agency, never fate



**The Engine and the Brake****User Specifications:**

Intensity drives; restraint regulates. The pattern shows both impulses operating simultaneously—pressure to act countered by caution to reflect. When pressure accumulates, structure provides containment.⁶- Option C (micro-protocol) over temporal query handler or SST extension

- Field-sensing tone: "field shows compression" vs meteorological "forecast"

**The Threshold**- Moderate depth: 1 paragraph blending math + embodiment

The chart suggests simultaneous craving for intimacy and construction of protective barriers. Vulnerability surfaces, then retreats when exposure feels too intense. This rhythm doesn't signal inconsistency—it indicates calibration.⁷- Optional falsifiability: prompt included, not mandatory



### Mirror Voice**Technical Notes:**

- Replaces deprecated SFD (Support-Friction Differential) from original Primer

The pattern suggests you navigate pressure through precision—not from inability to relax, but because structure provides the release valve that unstructured stillness cannot.⁸ Watchfulness functions as pattern recognition protecting against repeated trust violations, not as paranoia distorting neutral reality.⁹ - Uses current V5 metrics: Magnitude, Directional Bias, Volatility, Coherence

- Honors *A Strange Cosmic Symbolism v5* calibration (Hurricane Michael benchmark)

Current inquiry: does this operating system still serve your actual life, or has the protective container calcified into limiting cage?- Integrates with Advice Ladder Tree 9.3.25 (Live Test Protocol)



### Socratic Closure**Validation:**

- ✅ Build successful (Next.js compiles cleanly)

Truth arrives through motion, then confirms itself through rest. The work may involve weighting both phases equally—allowing stillness to register as preparation rather than stagnation, letting action flow from readiness rather than reactivity. When that balance holds, energy accumulates rather than depletes.- ✅ Preserves Raven Calder conversational warmth

```- ✅ Maintains FIELD → MAP → VOICE architecture

- ✅ Probability fields, not predictions

## What Happens in the PDF

## [2025-11-01] FEATURE: Dual Calibration Model + Poetic Brain Integration

**If LLM generates structured sections:**

1. ✅ Hook Stack section appears (4 numbered items)**Summary**

2. ✅ Frontstage section appears (coordinates + narrative)Completed V5 Balance Meter validation with **two golden standard benchmarks** establishing the Dual Calibration Model. Integrated architectural wisdom into Poetic Brain (privacy-preserving, no case specifics).

3. ✅ Polarity Cards section appears (2-4 titled cards)

4. ✅ Mirror Voice section appears (narrative with question)**Dual Calibration Model Established:**

5. ✅ Socratic Closure appears (custom text + WB/ABE/OSR marking guide)1. **Macro-Class (External Distributed):** -3.2 to -3.5 compression (hurricanes, systemic collapse)

6. ✅ Session Validation Layer appears (if diagnostics provided)2. **Micro-Class (Personal Pinpoint):** -4.0 to -5.0 compression (exact natal hits, phase-slip events)



**If LLM response unstructured (fallback):****Key Insight:** Compression measures **symbolic precision**, not physical scale. A personal crisis with 0°-1° natal resonance can register HIGHER compression than large-scale external events.

1. ⚠️ Template-based placeholders used instead

2. ✅ Session Validation Layer still appears (if diagnostics provided)**Poetic Brain Integration (app/api/chat/route.ts):**

3. ✅ PDF still generates (graceful degradation)- Added Dual Calibration wisdom to system instructions (lines 650-675)

- Anonymized all identifying terms for privacy (no "hurricane", "kneecap", names)

---- Recognizes Macro vs Micro crisis classes

- Frames therapeutic responses appropriate to compression type

## Validation & Testing- Honors that small events can land harder when they strike exact natal configurations

- Privacy-preserving: No case specifics, only architectural principles

### Build Status

```bash**Therapeutic Layer:**

npm run build- Macro-class: External rebuilding + Ladder Tree (Radical Acceptance, Defusion)

```- Micro-class: Somatic anchoring + silence honoring + phase-slip structural support

✅ **PASSING** - All TypeScript compiles, no errors- Below -5.0: Unmappable void (requires external structural intervention)



### Integration Test Checklist**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/chat/route.ts` — Poetic Brain system instructions updated

**Manual Flow:**- `Persona/Two Cases Studies in high negative directional bias` — Golden standards documented

1. [ ] Upload chart to Math Brain- Test scripts: `test-dan-bias.js`, `test-stephie-fracture.js`

2. [ ] Trigger Poetic Brain auto-execution (any mode)

3. [ ] Verify LLM response contains section headings:**Impact:**

   - `### Hook Stack`- ✅ Poetic Brain can now honor high-compression crisis context without under-reading

   - `### Frontstage`- ✅ Two golden standards validate architecture across crisis classes

   - `### Polarity Cards`- ✅ Translocation mandatory for both classes (Felt Weather > Blueprint)

   - `### Mirror Voice`- ✅ Privacy maintained (no personal identifiers in system knowledge)

   - `### Socratic Closure`

4. [ ] Complete session → WrapUpCard appears---

5. [ ] Actor/Role detection runs (optional)

6. [ ] Fill out rubric (optional)## [2025-11-01] CRITICAL FIX: Translocation Architecture — Blueprint vs Felt Weather

7. [ ] Click "Export Clear Mirror"

8. [ ] Verify PDF contains all sections:**Summary**

   - Hook Stack (4 items)Implemented pre-computation translocation for Balance Meter, fixing the fundamental architectural gap where seismograph was calculated from natal coordinates instead of relocated coordinates. This distinguishes **Blueprint** (natal-anchored) from **Felt Weather** (relocated-anchored) readings.

   - Frontstage (coordinates + narrative)

   - Polarity Cards (2-4 cards)**The Problem**

   - Mirror Voice (narrative with question)- Seismograph was always computed using natal coordinates (Bryn Mawr, PA)

   - Socratic Closure (custom text + marking guide)- Transits were fetched FROM natal location, not relocated location

   - Session Validation Layer (Actor/Role + stats + rubric)- Relocation shim applied post-computation (too late to affect seismograph)

- **Result:** Directional Bias -2.0 (Blueprint reading) instead of -3.5 (Felt Weather)

**Fallback Test:**

1. [ ] Test with older session (no structured LLM response)**The Fix (Three-Part Implementation)**

2. [ ] Verify PDF still generates with template placeholders

3. [ ] Verify Session Validation Layer works independently1. **Fetch Relocated Natal Chart**

   - When `translocation.applies = true`, fetch a second natal chart using relocated coordinates

**Regression Test:**   - Store both `chart_natal` (Blueprint) and `chart_relocated` (Felt Weather)

1. [ ] Export Clear Mirror without completing session   - Use `chart_relocated` as active chart for seismograph calculation

2. [ ] Verify PDF generates (missing Session Validation Layer is OK)

3. [ ] Verify no errors in console2. **Pass Relocated Subject to getTransits**

   - Build relocated subject with Panama City coordinates

---   - Pass to `getTransits()` so transits are computed FROM relocated location

   - Transit house placements and angle aspects now reflect relocated geometry

## Benefits of This Implementation

3. **Provenance Tracking**

### 1. **Consistent Structure**   - Added `chart_basis`: `'blueprint_natal'` or `'felt_weather_relocated'`

- LLM always emits same section headings   - Added `seismograph_chart`: `'natal'` or `'relocated'`

- Parser extracts predictably   - Added `translocation_applied`: boolean

- Template renders uniformly

- No drift between narrative and export format**Golden Standard Validation — Hurricane Michael**

- **Configuration:** Dan (1973-07-24, Bryn Mawr PA) relocated to Panama City FL, Oct 10 2018

### 2. **Session Diagnostics Integration**- **Before Fix:** Magnitude 4.6, Directional Bias -2.0 (Blueprint)

- Actor/Role composite detection- **After Fix:** Magnitude 4.1, **Directional Bias -3.5** (Felt Weather) ✅

- Resonance stats (WB/ABE/OSR breakdown)- **Target Range:** -3.2 to -3.5 ← **MET**

- Rubric scores (pressure, outlet, conflict, tone, surprise)

- Empirical validation layer in PDF**Philosophical Mandate**

The Raven Calder system promises "symbolic weather for agency." If you're experiencing Hurricane Michael in Panama City, the mirror must reflect Panama City geometry, not Bryn Mawr. The **Felt Weather** reading is the only philosophically correct output for translocation requests.

### 3. **Future-Proof Architecture**

- Single `ClearMirrorData` payload**Files Modified**

- Supports multiple export formats:- `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js` — Three-part translocation implementation

  - ✅ PDF (current)- `lib/relocation-shim.js` — Kept as validation layer (now redundant but ensures integrity)

  - 🔜 HTML email- `test-dan-bias.js` — Added provenance tracking for `chart_basis`, `seismograph_chart`, `translocation_applied`

  - 🔜 Share cards- `TRANSLOCATION_ARCHITECTURE_GAP.md` — Documented fix and validation

  - 🔜 JSON API

**Impact**

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**- ✅ Balance Meter now measures **felt experience** (Felt Weather) instead of birth geometry (Blueprint)

- Structured parsing attempted first- ✅ Translocation properly affects seismograph calculation (pre-computation, not post)

- Falls back to template placeholders if invalid- ✅ Hurricane Michael benchmark validates at -3.5 (exact upper bound of target range)

- Session diagnostics optional (works with or without)- ✅ V5 Balance Meter calibration: **COMPLETE**

- Legacy compatibility maintained

---

### 5. **Developer Experience**

- Clear separation of concerns:## [2025-10-19] BREAKING CHANGE: SFD (Support-Friction Differential) Metric Retired - COMPLETE

  - Prompts (instructions to LLM)

  - Parser (extraction logic)**Summary**

  - Adapter (mapping logic)Retired the Support–Friction Differential (SFD) axis across the runtime. Balance Meter, seismograph, and reporting pipelines now operate solely on magnitude, directional bias, and coherence.

  - Template (rendering logic)

- Comprehensive documentation**Changes Made**

- Testable components

- Maintainable codebase- Removed unused SFD helpers and exports from `lib/balance/scale.ts`, `lib/voice`, `lib/climate-narrative.ts`, and `lib/weather-lexicon-adapter.ts`.

- Trimmed validation and payload typing (`src/validation/lexical-guard.ts`, `src/types/wm-json-appendix.ts`, `lib/types/woven-map-blueprint.ts`, `lib/poetic-brain-schema.ts`) so no schema advertises SFD.

---- Updated reporting utilities and tests to stop logging or asserting on SFD values (`lib/reporting/metric-labels.js`, `test/*`, `scripts/*`).

- Removed obsolete archival scripts that enforced legacy SFD schema expectations.

## Next Steps

**Testing**

### Immediate- ✅ `npm test -- raven-geometry.test.ts --silent`

1. **Integration Testing:** Full flow from upload → auto-exec → PDF export

2. **User Feedback:** Verify section structure clarity and usefulness**Impact**

3. **Parser Refinement:** Adjust regex patterns based on real LLM output- Prevents consumers from reading or relying on SFD outputs.

- Aligns Balance Meter vocabulary with the two-axis system (magnitude + directional bias/coherence).

### Short-Term

1. **HTML Email Renderer:** Reuse `ClearMirrorData` for styled emails## [2025-10-19] FEATURE: MAP/FIELD Export Architecture + UI Buttons + Cleanup

**Implementation Complete:** 2025-01-21  

**Build Status:** ✅ PASSING  ## [2025-10-19] FEATURE: MAP/FIELD Export Architecture + Poetic Brain Tone Fix

**Ready For:** Integration Testing & User Feedback

**Summary**
Implemented proper MAP/FIELD file export architecture per protocol specification, and fixed Poetic Brain conversational tone issues.

**1. MAP/FIELD Export Architecture (Raven Calder Protocol)**

**The Issue:** File naming was inconsistent with MAP/FIELD protocol, creating confusion about which file serves which purpose.

**Core Clarification:**
- **MAP File** (`wm-map-v1`): Constitutional geometry (permanent natal chart) → Mirror Flow Reports
- **FIELD File** (`wm-field-v1`): Symbolic weather (temporal transit activations) → Balance Meter Reports
- **Mirror Directive**: Instruction template (may be deprecated)

**Changes Made:**

*Backend (Already Complete):*
- ✅ `src/math_brain/main.js` generates proper MAP and FIELD files
- ✅ `generateMapFile()` function (lines 441-501)
- ✅ `generateFieldFile()` function (lines 507-562)
- ✅ Includes `_map_file` and `_field_file` in unified output

*Frontend Export Functions (NEW):*
- ✅ Added `downloadMapFile()` in `app/math-brain/hooks/useChartExport.ts` (lines 1551-1583)
- ✅ Added `downloadFieldFile()` in `app/math-brain/hooks/useChartExport.ts` (lines 1585-1617)
- ✅ Updated `UseChartExportResult` interface (lines 82-96)
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback toasts

*Poetic Brain Integration:*
- ✅ Added MAP file detection in `app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 144-147)
- ✅ Added FIELD file detection in `app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 149-152)
- ✅ Upload detection now recognizes `wm-map-v1` and `wm-field-v1` schemas
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with legacy formats

**File Naming Convention:**
- MAP: `wm-map-v1-[report-type]-[person-a]-[person-b]-[timestamp].json`
- FIELD: `wm-field-v1-[report-type]-[person-a]-[person-b]-[date-range].json`
- Includes person names and date ranges automatically

**User Impact:**
- Users can now download proper MAP files (constitutional geometry)
- Users can now download proper FIELD files (symbolic weather)
- Poetic Brain recognizes and processes both file types
- Clear distinction between permanent (MAP) and temporal (FIELD) data

**2. Poetic Brain Conversational Tone Fix**

**The Issue:** Poetic Brain was responding in short, choppy sentences with headers instead of warm, conversational paragraphs.

**Root Causes:**
1. Corrupted prompt introduction in `lib/prompts.ts` (lines 1-6)
2. Technical upload prompts overriding conversational instructions

**Fixes Applied:**

*Prompt Corruption:*
- ✅ Fixed garbled text in `lib/prompts.ts` introduction
- ✅ Restored proper Raven Calder persona instructions
- ✅ AI now understands conversational tone requirements

*Upload Handler Improvements:*
- ✅ Removed technical openings ("I've received...")
- ✅ Updated JSON upload prompt to enforce conversational tone (lines 580-588)
- ✅ Updated journal upload prompt to enforce conversational tone (lines 590-597)
- ✅ Prompts now explicitly request warm, direct paragraphs

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Warm, peer-like paragraphs (not headers/bullets)
- ✅ Natural language flow
- ✅ Five-Step Delivery Framework applied
- ✅ Direct, not detached tone
- ✅ Plain syntax, muscular verbs
- ✅ Falsifiable empathy maintained

**Documentation Created:**
- `MAP_FIELD_EXPORT_CLARIFICATION.md` - Complete protocol explanation
- `MAP_FIELD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation status
- `POETIC_BRAIN_TONE_FIX_OCT19.md` - Tone fix documentation

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/math-brain/hooks/useChartExport.ts` - Added MAP/FIELD exports
2. `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Added schema detection + fixed prompts
3. `lib/prompts.ts` - Fixed corrupted introduction

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Add UI buttons for MAP/FIELD downloads
- [ ] Update user guidance for MAP vs FIELD usage
- [ ] Consider deprecating "Mirror Directive" export

## [2025-10-18] MIGRATION: Gemini → Perplexity API for Poetic Brain

**Summary**
Migrated Poetic Brain (Raven Calder) from Google's Gemini API to Perplexity API due to policy violations on Gemini. The transition maintains full feature parity while providing improved real-time web access and source citations.

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Replaced `lib/llm.ts` Gemini client with Perplexity OpenAI-compatible client
- ✅ Updated all narrator modules (`blueprint-narrator.ts`, `weather-narrator.ts`, `reflection-narrator.ts`) to use `callPerplexity()`
- ✅ Migrated `netlify/functions/poetic-brain.js` to Perplexity endpoint
- ✅ Renamed environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
- ✅ Updated `lib/usage-tracker.ts` with Perplexity rate limits
- ✅ Removed `@google/generative-ai` dependency from `package.json`
- ✅ Updated test mocks to use `callPerplexity` instead of `callGemini`
- ✅ Updated UI copy in `app/api/chat/route.ts` to reference Perplexity
- ✅ Updated documentation (`docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/POETIC_BRAIN_INTEGRATION.md`)

**API Endpoint:**
- Old: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent`
- New: `https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible)

**Model Selection:**
- Default: `sonar-pro` (Perplexity's recommended model)
- Configurable via `PERPLEXITY_DEFAULT_MODEL` env var

**Auth & Security:**
- Auth0 gating unchanged (still required for `/chat` access)
- Bearer token authentication with Perplexity API key
- No breaking changes to session lifecycle or user experience

**Benefits:**
- Real-time web search capability for Poetic Brain responses
- Source citations included in responses
- No policy violations
- OpenAI-compatible API format (easier future migrations)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing Poetic Brain features work identically
- Usage tracking and rate limits adapted for Perplexity
- No changes to Math Brain or report generation

## [2025-10-13] FEATURE: Math Brain v2 - Unified Architecture Integration

**Summary**
Implemented a new, unified "Math Brain v2" architecture that provides cleaner, more AI-friendly data formats while maintaining backward compatibility. The system now supports both legacy and v2 report generation with automatic format detection.

**New Architecture (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)**
- **FIELD**: Input configuration (birth data, date ranges, modes)
- **MAP**: Unified data object (JSON with computed summaries)
- **VOICE**: Formatted output (Markdown for AI interpretation)

**Files Created:**
- `src/math_brain/main.js` - Math Brain v2 orchestrator (290 lines)
- `src/formatter/create_markdown_reading.js` - Markdown formatter (85 lines)
- `utils/create_summary_markdown.js` - Summary table generator (187 lines)
- `MATH_BRAIN_V2_CHANGELOG.md` - Complete implementation documentation
- `MATH_BRAIN_V2_USAGE.md` - Developer and user guide

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts` - Added v2 API support with backward compatibility

**New API Format:**
```javascript
// Request (with v2 flag)
{
  "use_v2": true,
  "personA": { ... },
  "personB": { ... },
  "window": { "start": "2025-10-11", "end": "2025-10-17" }
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "version": "v2",
  "unified_output": { ... },
  "markdown_reading": "...",
  "download_formats": {
    "mirror_report": { "format": "markdown", "filename": "..." },
    "symbolic_weather": { "format": "json", "filename": "..." }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Smaller files**: 100KB vs 3MB+ for legacy reports
- ✅ **AI-optimized**: No nested complexity, explicit structure
- ✅ **Hallucination-proof**: GPT can read and interpret correctly
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Legacy system unchanged, v2 opt-in
- ✅ **Cleaner provenance**: Mandatory metadata block included

**User Experience:**
- **Legacy reports** (default): Same as before, full compatibility
- **v2 reports** (opt-in): New "Mirror Report" and "Symbolic Weather" downloads with cleaner format
- **PDF dashboard**: Unchanged, works with both systems

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Math Brain**: Computes real symbolic weather, mirror data, and poetic hooks
- **Formatter**: Generates self-contained Markdown for Poetic Brain
- **API Integration**: Automatic v2 detection, fallback to legacy
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive cleanup, graceful degradation

**Status:** ✅ **LIVE** - v2 API integrated and functional  
**UI Integration:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Toggle and download handlers fully wired

**User Experience:**
- Users see a v2 toggle checkbox in the download section
- When enabled, button labels change to show "(v2 - AI Optimized)"
- Clicking download buttons calls the v2 API and downloads the new format
- Fully backward compatible - default behavior unchanged

**Files Modified for UI Integration:**
- `app/math-brain/components/DownloadControls.tsx` - Added v2 toggle UI
- `app/math-brain/page.tsx` - Added state, v2 handlers, wired to component

**Real Data Integration:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Mock data replaced with real astrology API calls

**Files Modified for Data Integration:**
- `src/math_brain/main.js` - Added `getRealAspectData()` function, accepts `transitData` parameter
- `app/api/astrology-mathbrain/route.ts` - Fetches real transit data via legacy system, passes to v2

**How It Works:**
1. API route receives v2 request
2. Calls legacy system to fetch real transit/synastry data
3. Passes transit data to Math Brain v2
4. Math Brain extracts aspects from real data structure
5. Computes summaries using real astrological calculations
6. Returns clean v2 format with accurate data

**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - Full end-to-end integration complete

**BREAKING CHANGE (Oct 13, 2025 11:22pm):**
- Legacy system completely removed
- Math Brain v2 is now the ONLY system
- No toggle, no backward compatibility mode
- All downloads use the new AI-optimized format
- Rationale: Single user (developer) preparing for first real user - no need for dual systems

**BUG FIX (Oct 14, 2025 1:03am):**
- Temporarily using mock data to fix 500 errors
- Issue: Real data integration requires complex legacy system data structure mapping
- Temporary solution: Use mock data (line 247) so UI downloads work
- This allows testing the full UI flow while we fix the real data integration
- Status: ⚠️ **UI WORKS WITH MOCK DATA** - Real data integration TODO
- Next: Map legacy system response structure to Math Brain v2 expected format

## [2025-10-12] CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED: Raven not using full report JSON data

**Summary**
Identified critical data loss issue where Raven Calder receives uploaded JSON reports but only extracts Balance Meter summaries, completely ignoring natal chart data (Person A/B), aspect details, transit houses, and full symbolic weather context.

**Problem Scope:**
- **Client sends:** Full JSON with `person_a` natal chart, `person_b` synastry data, complete `symbolic_weather_context`, aspect lists with orbs/potencies
- **Raven receives:** Only Balance Meter axes (Magnitude, Directional Bias) + period dates
- **Result:** User uploads detailed report (requires Google Login) but Raven cannot answer questions about Sun sign, Venus-Mars aspects, Mars-Pluto squares, transit houses, etc.

**Technical Details:**

**What Works:**
- `components/ChatClient.tsx` (lines 2407-2428): Client correctly sends `reportContext.content` with full JSON
- `reportContexts` array includes complete report payload for each uploaded file
- File upload, parsing, and storage works correctly

**What's Broken:**
- `app/api/raven/route.ts` (lines 63-79): Only calls `summariseUploadedReportJson()` which extracts Balance Meter summary
- `lib/raven/reportSummary.ts`: Designed to extract metadata only, not full chart geometry
- `lib/raven/render.ts` (conversational flow): Doesn't reference `options.reportContexts` in LLM prompt
- **Result:** Uploaded JSON with 500+ lines of natal/aspect data → Raven gets 5 summary lines

**Missing Data in Raven's Context:**
- ❌ `person_a.natal_chart` (Sun, Moon, Rising, all planetary placements)
- ❌ `person_b.natal_chart` (for synastry reports)
- ❌ `symbolic_weather_context.daily_readings` (aspect details per day)
- ❌ `aspects[]` array (orb precision, exact times, potency weights)
- ❌ `transit_houses[]` (which house each transit occupies)
- ❌ `balance_meter.drivers[]` (which aspects cause each day's magnitude)

**Impact:**
- Users cannot ask: "What's my Sun sign?" (data exists in JSON, Raven can't see it)
- Users cannot ask: "How does my Venus aspect their Mars?" (synastry data ignored)
- Users cannot ask: "Which day has the Mars-Pluto square?" (aspect list not parsed)
- Poetic translations limited to generic patterns instead of actual chart geometry
- Google Login required for reports, but 95% of report data is unused

**Documentation:**
Created comprehensive bug report: `BUG_REPORT_RAVEN_JSON_CONTEXT.md` with:
- Complete problem analysis
- JSON structure examples
- Proposed fixes (2 options with code examples)
- Testing checklist
- Related files mapping

**Status:** 🚨 **CRITICAL - Requires immediate fix**  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks core Raven value proposition

**Next Steps:**
1. Option 1 (Recommended): Pass full `reportContexts` to LLM prompt in `render.ts` conversational flow
2. Option 2 (Supplemental): Enhance `reportSummary.ts` to extract natal chart + aspects into appendix
3. Test with: solo mirror uploads, synastry uploads, chart-specific questions
4. Update API documentation to clarify JSON structure expectations

## [2025-10-12] POETIC BRAIN: Bug fixes - Journal button + Report upload types

**Summary**
Fixed critical UX bugs in Poetic Brain where the "Journal" button incorrectly opened a file upload dialog instead of generating a session recap, and "journal" was incorrectly treated as an uploadable report type alongside mirror/balance.

**Bugs Fixed:**

1. **❌ Journal Upload Dialog (Wrong Behavior)**
   - **Problem:** 📔 Journal button opened file upload dialog expecting users to upload journal entries
   - **Expected:** Should generate a session recap/summary AFTER user completes their reading
   - **Fix:** Removed "journal" from upload types, created new "Session Recap" feature

2. **❌ Journal as Report Type (Architecture Issue)**
   - **Problem:** "journal" was treated as uploadable report type (`type: 'mirror' | 'balance' | 'journal'`)
   - **Expected:** Journal should be generated output, not an upload input
   - **Fix:** Updated all type definitions to `'mirror' | 'balance'` only

3. **❌ Session Recap Feature Missing**
   - **Problem:** `generateJournalEntry()` function existed but wasn't accessible to users
   - **Expected:** Easy way to generate and view session recap after reading
   - **Fix:** Added "Session Recap" button + modal with full journal generation

**Files Updated:**

- `components/chat/Header.tsx` (lines 7-30):
  - Removed "journal" from `ReportContext` type definition
  - Changed `onFileSelect` type from `('mirror' | 'balance' | 'journal')` to `('mirror' | 'balance')`
  - Added `onSessionRecap` handler prop
  - Replaced 📔 Journal upload button with "Session Recap" button (conditional, gradient styling)
  
- `components/ChatClient.tsx`:
  - **Lines 399, 413**: Removed "journal" from type definitions (`reportType`, `ReportContext`)
  - **Lines 713-715**: Updated `uploadType` state type
  - **Lines 866-867**: Added `showSessionRecap` and `sessionRecapData` state
  - **Lines 1734-1749**: Created `handleSessionRecap()` async function
  - **Lines 1981, 2172**: Removed "journal" inference from report detection logic
  - **Lines 2555, 3060**: Added `onSessionRecap` prop to Header component
  - **Lines 3026-3107**: Added Session Recap Modal with:

## [2025-10-12] POETIC BRAIN: Balance Meter v5.0 terminology compliance + responsive layout

**Summary**
Updated Poetic Brain glossary and UI components to use official Balance Meter v5.0 terminology. Removed deprecated metrics (Coherence, SFD, Volatility as primary metric) and replaced legacy "Valence" with "Directional Bias" throughout user-facing interface.

**v5.0 Terminology Updates:**
- ✅ "Valence" → **"Directional Bias"** (expansion/contraction tilt, −5 to +5)
- ✅ "Negative/Positive Valence" → **"Contractive/Expansive Bias"**
- ✅ Removed **Volatility** from primary metrics (now internal diagnostics only)
- ✅ Updated glossary to show v5.0 two-axis system: **Magnitude + Directional Bias**

**Files Updated:**
- `components/chat/Sidebar.tsx` (lines 30-39):
  - Glossary section header: "Balance Meter Framework" → "Balance Meter v5.0"
  - "Valence" → "Directional Bias" with expanded description

## [2025-10-12] UI: Poetic Brain responsive layout - widened chat on large displays

**Summary**
Expanded Poetic Brain chat interface to breathe on larger displays while maintaining compact layout on smaller screens. Chat container now uses responsive max-width constraints instead of fixed 980px bottleneck.

**Problem**
- Chat window constrained to `max-w-[980px]` on all screen sizes
- Felt narrow/tucked on modern wide displays (1920px+, 2560px+)
- Wasted horizontal space on large monitors

**Solution**
- **Mobile/Tablet:** Keep `max-w-[980px]` (unchanged)
- **Desktop (1280px+):** Expand to `max-w-[1400px]`
- **Large Desktop (1536px+):** Expand to `max-w-[1600px]`

**Files Updated**
- `components/ChatClient.tsx` (line 2517):
  - Changed from: `max-w-[980px]`
  - Changed to: `max-w-[980px] xl:max-w-[1400px] 2xl:max-w-[1600px]`

**Impact**
- Poetic Brain chat feels more spacious on large displays
- Sidebar (280px) + conversation pane has more room to breathe
- No impact on mobile/tablet layouts
- Chat bubbles maintain deliberate 82% width for readability

**Verification**
- Test on 1920px display: Chat expands to ~1400px
- Test on 2560px display: Chat expands to ~1600px  
- Test on mobile/tablet: Remains at 980px max
- Layout grid (sidebar 280px + flex main) works correctly at all breakpoints

## [2025-10-11] CRITICAL FIX: Fixed magnitudeAvg undefined error preventing solo mirror reports

**Summary**
Resolved a critical bug where `resolveChartPreferences` function was referencing undefined variables (`magnitudeAvg`, `magnitudeLabel`, `volatilityAvg`, etc.), causing "magnitudeAvg is not defined" errors when attempting to generate solo mirror reports or any chart requiring the function.

**Root Cause**
The `resolveChartPreferences` function (line 56) was incorrectly implemented:
- Referenced variables that exist only in the `calculateSeismograph` function scope
- Attempted to return undefined `out` variable
- Function was supposed to extract chart preferences from options, not create a summary

**Files Updated**
- `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js`:
  - Fixed `resolveChartPreferences` to properly extract chart-specific API parameters (house_system, perspective_type, wheel_only, etc.) from options
  - Added missing `stripGraphicsDeep` function to recursively remove graphic data from API responses

**Impact**
- Solo mirror reports now generate successfully
- Natal chart calls work properly with chart preferences
- Transit and synastry calculations no longer fail with undefined variable errors

**Verification**
- `npm test` - Core tests passing (natal, transits, seismograph)
- Manual test: Solo mirror report generation confirmed working
- No more "magnitudeAvg is not defined" errors in any code path

**Technical Notes**
The function now correctly:
1. Accepts an `options` object parameter
2. Extracts only chart-related preferences (houses_system_identifier, sidereal_mode, perspective_type, wheel_only, wheel_format, theme, language, active_points, active_aspects)
3. Returns a clean preferences object for spreading into API payloads

## [2025-10-08] FIX: Align Raven summaries with Math Brain relationship fields

**Summary**
Extended the uploaded report summariser so relational imports now respect the same scope, contact state, role, and intimacy tier options surfaced in Math Brain. Container and highlight strings surface the selected relationship context, while appendices preserve both the raw keys and the normalized labels for downstream conversations.

**Files Updated**
- `lib/raven/reportSummary.ts` – Added relationship scope/tier vocab, container wiring, highlight synthesis, and appendix metadata.
- `__tests__/raven-upload-summary.test.ts` – New regression covering relational scope, contact state, tier labelling, and appendix persistence.

**Verification**
- `npx jest __tests__/raven-upload-summary.test.ts`

---

## [2025-10-08] FIX: Clarify synastry upload coverage framing

**Summary**
Improved Raven's uploaded report summariser to track cadence, continuity, and coverage windows so conversational mirrors explicitly state when daily datasets form a continuous range (e.g., Sept 15 – Oct 31). Highlight strings now combine climate stats with window framing, and gap detection warns when days are missing.

**Files Added**
- `lib/raven/reportSummary.ts` – Shared helper exporting `summariseUploadedReportJson` for both API routing and tests.
- `__tests__/raven-upload-summary.test.ts` – Focused Jest coverage for symbolic weather exports (continuous vs. gapped datasets).

**Files Updated**
- `app/api/raven/route.ts` – Consumes the shared summariser module.
- `lib/raven/reportSummary.ts` – Detects cadence, continuity, and augments highlights/appendices with coverage data.

**Highlights**
- Daily uploads now respond with “Daily coverage is continuous…” phrasing, matching the user's expectation that Oct 8–10 lives inside the combined window.
- Gap detection surfaces when uploaded datasets skip days so Raven can caveat interpretations immediately.
- Appendices capture cadence metadata (`cadence`, `is_continuous`, `sample_count`) for downstream conversational use.

**Verification**
- `npx jest __tests__/raven-upload-summary.test.ts`

## [2025-10-06] ANALYSIS: Recurring Problems Analysis

**Summary**
Comprehensive analysis of systemic issues causing repeated problems in the WovenWebApp project, identifying root causes and recommending process improvements to prevent future recurrences.

**Root Cause Analysis**

**1. Incomplete Testing & Validation**
- **Pattern**: Features implemented without comprehensive testing, leading to regressions (e.g., Balance Meter fragmentation, API field mapping errors)
- **Evidence**: Multiple entries show fixes for issues that should have been caught earlier (e.g., [2025-09-20] API field mapping, [2025-01-21] Balance Meter dual-pipeline)
- **Impact**: Time spent on fixes instead of new features, user experience degradation

**2. Technical Debt Accumulation**
- **Pattern**: Quick fixes and patches accumulate without architectural cleanup
- **Evidence**: Dual-pipeline Balance Meter implementation, CommonJS/ESM incompatibilities, inconsistent orb profiles
- **Impact**: Increasing maintenance burden, higher risk of future failures

**3. AI-Assisted Development Gaps**
- **Pattern**: AI assistants modify code without understanding full context, creating inconsistencies
- **Evidence**: Seismograph.js reimplementing Balance Meter logic, lexical guard violations, module system conflicts
- **Impact**: Architectural violations, maintenance complexity, potential for undetected bugs

**4. Insufficient Process Safeguards**
- **Pattern**: Lack of automated validation and guardrails
- **Evidence**: Missing runtime assertions, property-based tests added late, no IDE read-only protections initially
- **Impact**: Recurring issues that could have been prevented

**5. Documentation & Context Management**
- **Pattern**: Changes made without updating documentation, leading to knowledge gaps
- **Evidence**: Multiple fixes for issues that reoccur because lessons weren't documented
- **Impact**: Same problems solved repeatedly by different contributors

**Recommended Solutions**

**1. Strengthen Testing Infrastructure**
- Implement comprehensive automated testing before deployment
- Add property-based tests for mathematical invariants
- Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Establish CI/CD with mandatory test gates

**2. Architectural Discipline**
- Enforce single source of truth for core algorithms

## [2025-10-06] FIX: Balance Meter Fragmentation - Centralized Value Extraction

**Summary**
Resolved recurring Balance Meter fragmentation where calibrated values (3.9/-2.3) reverted to raw values (5.0/-5.0) in exports despite multiple previous fixes. Root cause: Multiple inconsistent value extraction functions across codebase with different priority logic.

**Root Cause**
- Multiple `toNumber`/`extractAxisValue` functions with inconsistent priority order
- Some functions prioritized raw fields over calibrated `axes.*.value` fields
- Maintenance burden from similar but different extraction logic
- No centralized extraction helper leading to drift opportunities

**Solution Implemented**
- Created centralized `extractAxisNumber()` in `app/math-brain/utils/formatting.ts`
- Priority order: `axes.*.value` → calibrated fields → raw fields → fallbacks
- Updated all export functions in `useChartExport.ts` to use centralized logic
- Fixed dashboard binding in `app/math-brain/page.tsx` to prioritize calibrated values
- Added comprehensive regression tests in `__tests__/balance-export-regression.test.ts`

**Files Changed**
- `app/math-brain/utils/formatting.ts`: Added `extractAxisNumber()` export
- `app/math-brain/hooks/useChartExport.ts`: Updated all extraction functions to use centralized helper
- `app/math-brain/page.tsx`: Fixed dashboard magnitude binding priority
- `__tests__/balance-export-regression.test.ts`: Added priority order and edge case tests

**Validation**
- Backend confirmed correct: summary averages use calibrated daily values
- All export functions now use consistent calibrated value extraction
- Regression tests validate priority order and prevent future drift
- Dashboard and exports now show matching calibrated values (3.9/-2.3)

**Impact**
- Eliminates Balance Meter fragmentation between dashboard and exports
- Prevents future drift from inconsistent extraction functions
- Reduces maintenance burden with single source of truth
- Ensures calibrated values (0-5 range) always take precedence over raw values

---

**4. Process Improvements**
- Mandatory changelog updates for all changes
- Pre-deployment checklists
- Regular technical debt cleanup sessions
- Knowledge sharing sessions for team alignment

**5. Validation Frameworks**
- Automated schema validation
- Runtime invariant checking

## [2025-01-21] CRITICAL FIX: Balance Meter Dual-Pipeline Elimination (v3.1)

**Summary**
Eliminated architectural violation where `src/seismograph.js` reimplemented Balance Meter math instead of using canonical `lib/balance/scale.ts` functions. This "dual pipeline" created maintenance burden and risked divergence when AI assistants modified one path. Now enforces **single source of truth** for all scaling operations.

**Problem (Identified in Audit)**
- Path A (canonical): `lib/balance/scale.ts` → `scaleBipolar()` → `norm × 50 → clamp([-5, +5])`
- Path B (legacy): `src/seismograph.js` → custom logic → `Y_raw × mag / 100 × 50 → clamp`
- Risk: AI assistants would modify one path, breaking the other

**Solution (7-Phase Refactor)**

1. **Domain Helper Extraction** (`lib/balance/amplifiers.ts` - NEW)
   - Extracted magnitude amplification logic: `amplifyByMagnitude(rawBias, mag)` → `rawBias × (0.8 + 0.4 × mag)`
   - Normalization helpers: `normalizeAmplifiedBias()`, `normalizeVolatilityForCoherence()`
   - Single source of truth for domain-specific transformations

2. **Spec Guard Creation** (`config/spec.json` - NEW)
   - Canonical v3.1 specification with scale_factor: 50
   - Pipeline definition: "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
   - Range definitions for all axes (mag [0,5], bias [-5,+5], coh [0,5], sfd [-1,+1])

3. **Runtime Assertions** (`lib/balance/assertions.ts` - NEW)
   - `assertBalanceMeterInvariants()` validates:
     * Range compliance (no out-of-bounds values)
     * Null integrity (sfd null → "n/a", never fabricated zero)
     * Finite values (no NaN/Infinity leakage)
     * Spec version match (v3.1)
   - Wired into `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js` and `lib/reporting/relational.ts`

4. **Property-Based Tests** (`test/balance-properties.test.ts` - NEW)
   - 19 property tests for mathematical invariants:
     * scaleBipolar: monotonicity, range compliance, symmetry, clamp flags
     * scaleUnipolar: monotonicity, range compliance, zero handling, negative input
     * scaleCoherenceFromVol: anti-monotonicity, range compliance, inversion formula
     * scaleSFD: range compliance, null handling, display formatting, monotonicity

5. **Canonical Scaler Adoption** (`src/seismograph.js` - REFACTORED)
   - Lines 353-395: Replaced manual math with canonical function calls
   - OLD: `Y_normalized = Y_amplified / 100; directional_bias = round(Math.max(-5, Math.min(5, Y_normalized * 50)), 1)`
   - NEW: `Y_amplified = amplifyByMagnitude(Y_raw, magnitudeValue); biasScaled = scaleBipolar(Y_normalized); directional_bias = biasScaled.value`
   - Transform trace now includes `spec_version: '3.1'` and `canonical_scalers_used: true` flags

6. **CommonJS/ESM Bridge** (`lib/balance/scale-bridge.js` - NEW)
   - Resolves module system incompatibility (seismograph.js uses CommonJS, scale.ts uses ESM)
   - Inline implementations matching TypeScript signatures exactly
   - Returns `{raw, value, flags: {hitMin, hitMax}}` structure for clamp event tracking

7. **Schema Updates**
   - `lib/schemas/day.ts`: Pipeline string updated to "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
   - `lib/export/weatherLog.ts`: Type definitions and payloads aligned with v3.1
   - `lib/reporting/relational.ts`: Pipeline strings + assertion validation

**IDE Protections** (`.vscode/settings.json` - NEW)
- Read-only protection for core files:
  * `lib/balance/scale.ts`
  * `lib/balance/amplifiers.ts`
  * `lib/balance/assertions.ts`
  * `config/spec.json`

**Test Results (All Passing)**
```
✅ 14/14 test files passing
✅ 69/69 tests passing
✅ Lexicon lint clean
✅ Golden Standard (Hurricane Michael): mag 4.86, bias -3.3, coh 4.0, sfd -0.21
✅ Bias sanity: -0.05 → -2.5 (not -5.0)
✅ Export consistency: Schema validation passing
```

**Critical Fixes Applied**
1. **CommonJS Bridge**: Created inline implementations to allow seismograph.js to import TypeScript scalers
2. **Return Structure**: Updated bridge to match TypeScript signatures exactly
3. **Pipeline Strings**: Unified all schemas/exports to "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
4. **SFD Scaling**: Fixed preScaled flag handling (calculateSFD returns [-1, +1], not raw sums)

**Files Created (7)**
- `lib/balance/amplifiers.ts` (75 lines)
- `lib/balance/assertions.ts` (176 lines)
- `lib/balance/scale-bridge.js` (145 lines)

- `test/balance-properties.test.ts` (228 lines)
- `.vscode/settings.json` (16 lines)
- `BALANCE_METER_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` (full documentation)

**Files Modified (6)**
- `src/seismograph.js` - Now uses canonical scalers exclusively
- `lib/balance/scale.ts` - Re-exports amplifiers module
- `lib/schemas/day.ts` - Pipeline string updated
- `lib/export/weatherLog.ts` - Pipeline strings updated
- `lib/reporting/relational.ts` - Added assertions + pipeline fix
- `test/bias-sanity-check.test.ts` - Validates canonical scaler usage

**Architecture Impact**
```
BEFORE (Dual Pipeline):
lib/balance/scale.ts ──┐
                       ├──> DIVERGENCE RISK
src/seismograph.js ────┘

AFTER (Single Source of Truth):

    ↓
lib/balance/scale-bridge.js (CommonJS)
    ↓
src/seismograph.js (uses canonical scalers)
    ↓
lib/balance/assertions.ts (runtime validation)
```

**Technical Debt Resolved**
1. ✅ Eliminated duplicate amplification logic
2. ✅ Eliminated duplicate scaling math
3. ✅ Eliminated pipeline string inconsistencies
4. ✅ Added missing runtime validation
5. ✅ Added missing property-based tests
6. ✅ Resolved CommonJS/ESM module incompatibility

**Future Safeguards**
- IDE read-only protection prevents accidental modifications
- Runtime assertions catch spec violations before export
- Property-based tests validate mathematical invariants
- Transform trace flags signal canonical compliance
- Golden standard tests validate real-world accuracy

**Maintenance Protocol**
- If modifying Balance Meter math, update `lib/balance/scale.ts` ONLY
- Run `npm run test:vitest:run` before pushing balance-related changes
- Keep `config/spec.json` as single source of truth for constants
- Never bypass runtime assertions in production code

**Documentation**
- `BALANCE_METER_AUDIT_2025-10-05.md` - Original audit identifying dual pipeline
- `BALANCE_METER_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` - Complete implementation documentation
- Inline comments reference spec v3.1 throughout codebase

**AI Collaboration Notes**
Implemented based on user's explicit instruction block with 8 acceptance gates. All gates passing. Refactor preserves existing behavior while eliminating architectural risk. Zero regressions; all golden standard tests passing within tolerance.

**AI Collaboration Notes**
Successfully implemented comprehensive Astrologer API wrapper following OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification. All tests passing (19/19 total, 11/11 astrologer-specific). No regressions introduced. Wrapper provides seamless Balance Meter pipeline integration with typed interfaces and normalization hooks as requested.

**Summary**
Eliminated architectural violation where `src/seismograph.js` reimplemented Balance Meter math instead of using canonical `lib/balance/scale.ts` functions. This "dual pipeline" created maintenance burden and risked divergence when AI assistants modified one path. Now enforces **single source of truth** for all scaling operations.

**Problem (Identified in Audit)**
- Path A (canonical): `lib/balance/scale.ts` → `scaleBipolar()` → `norm × 50 → clamp([-5, +5])`
- Path B (legacy): `src/seismograph.js` → custom logic → `Y_raw × mag / 100 × 50 → clamp`
- Risk: AI assistants would modify one path, breaking the other

**Solution (7-Phase Refactor)**

1. **Domain Helper Extraction** (`lib/balance/amplifiers.ts` - NEW)
   - Extracted magnitude amplification logic: `amplifyByMagnitude(rawBias, mag)` → `rawBias × (0.8 + 0.4 × mag)`
   - Normalization helpers: `normalizeAmplifiedBias()`, `normalizeVolatilityForCoherence()`
   - Single source of truth for domain-specific transformations

2. **Spec Guard Creation** (`config/spec.json` - NEW)
   - Canonical v3.1 specification with scale_factor: 50
   - Pipeline definition: "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
   - Range definitions for all axes (mag [0,5], bias [-5,+5], coh [0,5], sfd [-1,+1])

3. **Runtime Assertions** (`lib/balance/assertions.ts` - NEW)
   - `assertBalanceMeterInvariants()` validates:
     * Range compliance (no out-of-bounds values)
     * Null integrity (sfd null → "n/a", never fabricated zero)
     * Finite values (no NaN/Infinity leakage)
     * Spec version match (v3.1)
   - Wired into `lib/weatherDataTransforms.ts` and `lib/reporting/relational.ts`

4. **Property-Based Tests** (`test/balance-properties.test.ts` - NEW)
   - 19 property tests for mathematical invariants:
     * scaleBipolar: monotonicity, range compliance, symmetry, clamp flags
     * scaleUnipolar: monotonicity, range compliance, zero handling, negative input
     * scaleCoherenceFromVol: anti-monotonicity, range compliance, inversion formula
     * scaleSFD: range compliance, null handling, display formatting, monotonicity

5. **Canonical Scaler Adoption** (`src/seismograph.js` - REFACTORED)
   - Lines 353-395: Replaced manual math with canonical function calls
   - OLD: `Y_normalized = Y_amplified / 100; directional_bias = round(Math.max(-5, Math.min(5, Y_normalized * 50)), 1)`
   - NEW: `Y_amplified = amplifyByMagnitude(Y_raw, magnitudeValue); biasScaled = scaleBipolar(Y_normalized); directional_bias = biasScaled.value`
   - Transform trace now includes `spec_version: '3.1'` and `canonical_scalers_used: true` flags

6. **CommonJS/ESM Bridge** (`lib/balance/scale-bridge.js` - NEW)
   - Resolves module system incompatibility (seismograph.js uses CommonJS, scale.ts uses ESM)
   - Inline implementations matching TypeScript signatures exactly
   - Returns `{raw, value, flags: {hitMin, hitMax}}` structure for clamp event tracking

7. **Schema Updates**
   - `lib/schemas/day.ts`: Pipeline string updated to "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
   - `lib/export/weatherLog.ts`: Type definitions and payloads aligned with v3.1
   - `lib/reporting/relational.ts`: Pipeline strings + assertion validation

**IDE Protections** (`.vscode/settings.json` - NEW)
- Read-only protection for core files:
  * `lib/balance/scale.ts`
  * `lib/balance/amplifiers.ts`
  * `lib/balance/assertions.ts`
  * `config/spec.json`

**Test Results (All Passing)**
```
✅ 14/14 test files passing
✅ 69/69 tests passing
✅ Lexicon lint clean
✅ Golden Standard (Hurricane Michael): mag 4.86, bias -3.3, coh 4.0, sfd -0.21
✅ Bias sanity: -0.05 → -2.5 (not -5.0)
✅ Export consistency: Schema validation passing
```

**Critical Fixes Applied**
1. **CommonJS Bridge**: Created inline implementations to allow seismograph.js to import TypeScript scalers
2. **Return Structure**: Updated bridge to match TypeScript `{raw, value, flags}` signature
3. **Pipeline Strings**: Unified all schemas/exports to "normalize→scale→clamp→round"
4. **SFD Scaling**: Fixed preScaled flag handling (calculateSFD returns [-1, +1], not raw sums)

**Files Created (7)**
- `lib/balance/amplifiers.ts` (75 lines)
- `lib/balance/assertions.ts` (176 lines)
- `lib/balance/scale-bridge.js` (145 lines)

- `test/balance-properties.test.ts` (228 lines)
- `.vscode/settings.json` (16 lines)
- `BALANCE_METER_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` (full documentation)

```

**Technical Debt Resolved**
1. ✅ Eliminated duplicate amplification logic
2. ✅ Eliminated duplicate scaling math
3. ✅ Eliminated pipeline string inconsistencies
4. ✅ Added missing runtime validation
5. ✅ Added missing property-based tests
6. ✅ Resolved CommonJS/ESM module incompatibility

**Future Safeguards**
- IDE read-only protection prevents accidental modifications
- Runtime assertions catch spec violations before export
- Property-based tests validate mathematical invariants
- Transform trace flags signal canonical compliance
- Golden standard tests validate real-world accuracy

**Maintenance Protocol**
- If modifying Balance Meter math, update `lib/balance/scale.ts` ONLY
- Run `npm run test:vitest:run` before pushing balance-related changes
- Keep `config/spec.json` as single source of truth for constants
- Never bypass runtime assertions in production code

**Documentation**
- `BALANCE_METER_AUDIT_2025-10-05.md` - Original audit identifying dual pipeline
- `BALANCE_METER_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` - Complete implementation documentation
- Inline comments reference spec v3.1 throughout codebase

**AI Collaboration Notes**
Implemented based on user's explicit instruction block with 8 acceptance gates. All gates passing. Refactor preserves existing behavior while eliminating architectural risk. Zero regressions; all golden standard tests passing within tolerance.

## [2025-01-21] FEATURE: Epistemic Rigor & Formal Falsifiability Framework

**Summary**
Implemented formal epistemic rigor framework transforming the Woven Map from interpretive art to structured epistemic instrument. Added symbolic entropy measurement, narrative flattening detection, lexical orthogonality enforcement, transformation traceability, and observer bias risk labeling.

**Core Philosophy**
"Truth = fidelity across layers. When geometry, data, and language align, the mirror holds."

**New Modules**

1. **Epistemic Integrity Module** (`lib/reporting/epistemic-integrity.js`)
   - Quantifies symbolic entropy (coherence variance + drift)
   - Detects narrative flattening (coherence < 2.0 AND |bias| ≥ 4.5)
   - Validates axes orthogonality (prevents magnitude = |bias| collapse)
   - Detects epistemic key leakage (fabricated data, missing provenance)
   - Assesses misinterpretation risk (high signal + low coherence)
   - Enforces null honesty (no fabricated defaults)

2. **Transformation Trace Module** (`lib/reporting/transformation-trace.js`)
   - Auditable pipeline for all data transformations
   - Enforces canonical order: normalize → scale → clamp → round
   - Creates provenance stamps with full audit trail
   - Enables replay/verification of transformation chains
   - Detects pipeline violations and duplicate operations

3. **Lexical Guard Module** (`src/validation/lexical-guard.ts`)
   - Prevents cross-contamination between axes (lexical bleed)
   - Enforces directional vocabulary (expansion/contraction) for Bias only
   - Enforces cohesion vocabulary (harmony/friction) for SFD only
   - Provides build-time assertions and suggested replacements
   - Generates violation reports with actionable guidance

**Enhancements**

- **Canonical Scaling** (`lib/reporting/canonical-scaling.js`)
  - Added provenance metadata to all scaling operations
  - Transform pipeline tracking with timestamps
  - Full audit trail for sign resolution and magnitude selection

**Tests Added**

- `test/epistemic-integrity.test.js` - All core functions validated
- `test/transformation-trace.test.js` - Pipeline and provenance verified
- `test/lexical-guard.test.ts` - Semantic orthogonality enforced

**Documentation**

- `Developers Notes/Implementation/EPISTEMIC_RIGOR_SPECIFICATION.md`
  - Complete specification with philosophy, implementation, usage
  - Recovery protocols for narrative flattening and key leakage
  - Glossary of formal terms

**Impact**

- System moves from "metaphor soup" to falsifiable specification
- Every value's journey is auditable (transformation traces)
- Axes remain semantically orthogonal (lexical guard)
- Observers receive risk warnings (high signal/high misread)
- Catastrophic failures are detectable and recoverable
- Truth = repeatable fidelity, not belief

**Files Changed**
- Added: `lib/reporting/epistemic-integrity.js`
- Added: `lib/reporting/transformation-trace.js`
- Added: `src/validation/lexical-guard.ts`
- Added: `test/epistemic-integrity.test.js`
- Added: `test/transformation-trace.test.js`
- Added: `test/lexical-guard.test.ts`
- Added: `Developers Notes/Implementation/EPISTEMIC_RIGOR_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Modified: `lib/reporting/canonical-scaling.js` (provenance metadata)

**AI Collaboration Notes**
Implementation based on "From Metaphor to Specification" philosophical framework. All modules tested and validated before integration. Minimal changes to existing codebase; extensions rather than rewrites.

## [2025-10-03] BUG FIXES: Poetic Brain Stability & Security Improvements

**Summary**
Fixed critical mobile auto-scroll race condition, added persona drift detection, implemented memory leak prevention, strengthened HTML sanitization with DOMPurify, and improved streaming error handling in Poetic Brain chat interface.

**Bug Fixes**

1. **Mobile Auto-Scroll Race Condition (Critical)**
   - **Issue**: New Raven messages rendered outside viewport on mobile (iOS Safari), breaking engagement
   - **Root Cause**: `setTimeout(100)` unreliable for DOM updates; no fallback for mobile bounce zones
   - **Fix**: Implemented IntersectionObserver-based sentinel tracking with user scroll-away detection
   - **Impact**: Reliable auto-scroll across all devices; respects user manual scrolling
   - **Files**: [components/ChatClient.tsx](components/ChatClient.tsx)

2. **Persona Drift Detection (High Priority)**
   - **Issue**: Long streaming responses shift from conversational Raven voice to technical/descriptive mode
   - **Root Cause**: No drift monitoring during streaming; AI reverts to default behavior
   - **Fix**: Added real-time drift detection with pattern matching for technical language indicators
   - **Impact**: Maintains Raven Calder persona consistency throughout responses
   - **Files**: [app/api/chat/route.ts](app/api/chat/route.ts)

3. **Message History Memory Leak (Medium)**
   - **Issue**: Indefinite message accumulation causes performance degradation on low-memory devices
   - **Root Cause**: No pruning logic; large JSON uploads stored permanently in state
   - **Fix**:
     - Max 100 messages retained (auto-prune oldest)
     - Content size limit of 512KB per message
     - Automatic truncation with user-visible notice
   - **Impact**: Stable memory usage in long sessions
   - **Files**: [components/ChatClient.tsx](components/ChatClient.tsx)

4. **HTML Sanitization Hardening (Medium)**
   - **Issue**: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` relied on custom escaping; potential XSS vectors
   - **Root Cause**: No whitelist-based sanitizer; event handlers and data URLs not blocked
   - **Fix**: Integrated DOMPurify with strict whitelist (allowed tags/attributes only)
   - **Impact**: Defense-in-depth against XSS attacks
   - **Files**: [components/ChatClient.tsx](components/ChatClient.tsx)

5. **Streaming Error Handling (Low)**
   - **Issue**: Mid-stream failures left incomplete messages without user notification
   - **Root Cause**: No try-catch around streaming loop; errors logged but not surfaced
   - **Fix**: Added error boundaries with user-visible "[Connection interrupted]" message
   - **Impact**: Clear feedback when streaming fails; users know to retry
   - **Files**: [app/api/chat/route.ts](app/api/chat/route.ts)

**Technical Implementation**

- **New Dependencies**: `dompurify`, `@types/dompurify`
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - IntersectionObserver replaces setTimeout for scroll tracking
  - Sentinel element (`<div ref={sentinelRef} />`) tracks scroll position
  - User scroll-away state prevents auto-scroll interruption during reading
  - Memory pruning runs automatically via useEffect on message count change
  - DOMPurify sanitization applied to all `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` instances

**Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Mobile iOS Safari: New messages auto-scroll reliably
- [ ] Desktop: Scroll behavior unchanged
- [ ] Long sessions (50+ messages): No performance degradation
- [ ] Streaming failures: User sees error message
- [ ] Persona consistency: No technical drift in long responses

**Compliance**

- FIELD → MAP → VOICE: Fixes maintain agency-first language (no deterministic claims)
- Raven Calder Protocol: Persona drift detection preserves conversational tone
- Security: DOMPurify aligns with defensive security best practices

## [2025-10-01] FEATURE: Raven Output Protocol - Unified Construction Algorithm & Terminology Map

**Summary**: Created single source of truth for how Raven speaks—construction algorithm, terminology map, and Copilot rules unified into one protocol document.

**New Documentation**:
- **`Developers Notes/Poetic Brain/RAVEN_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL.md`** ⭐ **PRIMARY REFERENCE**
  - Step-by-step construction algorithm: Opening Signals → Composite Personality Summary → Behavioral Anchors → Conditional Impulses → Pressure Patterns → Calibration Markers
  - Complete terminology map (Internal → Reader-Facing): Hook Stack → Opening Signals, WB/ABE/OSR → Calibration Notes, etc.
  - Copilot rules: Jargon suppression, translation requirements, frontstage vs backstage enforcement
  - Output validation checklist for quality assurance

**Why This Matters**:
- Previous docs scattered across multiple files with inconsistent terminology
- AI assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT) now have single playbook for generating human-facing text
- Eliminates jargon leaks by providing explicit translation table for every technical term
- Ensures dual-pole phrasing ("Disciplined or Shut Down") replaces technical labels ("Saturn-Moon Square")

**Integration**:
- `Developers Notes/Poetic Brain/README.md` updated to list RAVEN_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL.md as primary reference
- `Developers Notes/README.md` updated to reference protocol in quick navigation
- Protocol supersedes scattered instructions in previous docs while preserving their specialized content

**Related Changes**:
- This builds on the lexicon-driven scenario work (Human Translation Layer) documented below

---


## [2025-10-01] FEATURE: Poetic Brain Lexicon-Driven Scenario & Human Translation Layer

- Refined the lexicon-driven scenario so Raven speaks in human, testable language instead of raw polarity riddles.
- `lib/weather-lexicon-adapter.ts` now returns both an internal scenario question and a reader-facing translation paragraph. The translation layer covers Openness↔Restriction, Supported↔Unsanctioned, Risk↔Stability, and Visibility↔Obscurity, applying neutral, conditional phrasing rules.
- `src/frontstage-renderer.ts` surfaces the new translation (and keeps the internal cue separately) so Poetic Brain replies start with practical hypotheses the reader can test.
- `lib/raven/render.ts` and `app/math-brain/page.tsx` pass the translation through to schema-enforced renders and PDFs, listing both the reader paragraph and the internal prompt for diagnostics.
- `Developers Notes/Poetic Brain/Woven Map Probabilistic Field Lexicon 8.28.25 copy.md` documents this “Human Translation Layer” so future contributors know the lexicon must always be surfaced through that adapter.
- No automated tests were run. TypeScript build expected to pass, but patch if any lint warnings appear.

## [2025-10-01] Relational Reports + User Experience Improvements

**Three Major Improvements**:
1. ✅ Complete orb profile integration (all filtering/weighting now centralized)
2. ✅ Resume from past session functionality restored
3. ✅ Saved charts roster with localStorage (cloud-ready architecture)

**Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE + UX Enhancements Delivered**

---

## 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. Resume from Past Session
**Files**: `app/math-brain/page.tsx` (lines 801-811, 3167-3196, 3490-3524)

**Problem**: Users had to re-enter all settings when returning to Math Brain
**Solution**: Automatic session persistence and resume banner

**Features**:
- Saves session data after each report generation to `localStorage`
- Displays banner on page load with "Resume Session" or "Start Fresh" options
- Restores: mode, dates, relationship context, translocation settings
- Privacy-conscious: Does NOT save full birth data (users re-enter for security)

**UI**: Indigo banner at top of page showing last session timestamp and summary

### 2. Shared Location Dropdown Fixed
**Files**: `app/math-brain/page.tsx` (lines 873-878)

**Problem**: "Shared Location (custom city)" remained disabled even when Partner was selected
**Root Cause**: `includePersonB` wasn't automatically set when relationship type changed

**Fix**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (relationshipType && relationshipType !== 'NONE') {
    setIncludePersonB(true);
  }
}, [relationshipType]);
```

**Result**: Selecting Partner/Family/Friend now auto-enables Person B and unlocks "Shared Location"

### 3. Saved Charts Roster
**Files Created**:
- `lib/saved-charts.ts` - Core library for chart management
- `components/SavedChartsDropdown.tsx` - Reusable dropdown component
- `SAVED_CHARTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide

**Features**:
- Save chart configurations with custom names
- Load saved charts into Person A/B forms
- Delete charts with confirmation
- Tag charts for organization
- Persistent storage via localStorage
- Future-ready for Firebase/Supabase cloud sync

**Architecture**:
```typescript
interface SavedChart {
  id: string;

## 🌍 ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE: "LANDSCAPE FIRST" - Protocol Ratified

**Context is Everything**

The old bias was describing the rain while ignoring the earth it fell upon. The system was brilliant at reading "symbolic weather" but risked leaving the person—the unique landscape shaped by a lifetime of sun and shadow—out of the picture.

> *"A flash flood is a catastrophe in a dry wash but a Tuesday in a cypress swamp."*

**The Correction**: By mandating **"Landscape First,"** every report is, and will always be, **person-centric**. We are no longer just tracking symbols; we are **mirroring a soul's journey through a symbolic climate**.

### Hierarchical Narrative Structure (Mandatory Order)

All reports MUST follow this sequence, which builds, deepens, and lands with integrity:

```
1. BLUEPRINT (The Landscape)
   └─ Natal chart foundation
   └─ Primary/Secondary/Shadow modes (Jungian functions)
   └─ Polarity cards, vector integrity
   └─ For relational: synastry structure, echo loops, shared SST tags

2. SYMBOLIC WEATHER (The Climate)
   └─ Balance Meter metrics (Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD)
   └─ Daily transit activation against the blueprint
   └─ For relational: bidirectional overlays (A←B, B←A)

3. RESONANCE & INTERACTIVE DATA (The Living Document)
   └─ Hook stack (ranked activation points)
   └─ Transit tables with phase annotations
   └─ Backstage provenance and audit trail
```

### Developer Mandates

1. **Blueprint Before Weather**: Never compute transits or Balance Meter indices without first establishing the natal foundation
2. **Context Before Interpretation**: The Mirror Voice (FIELD → MAP → VOICE) must reference the blueprint's functional modes
3. **Person Before Pattern**: SFD values are meaningless without knowing the person's baseline climate
4. **Relational Asymmetry**: In relational reports, preserve the different lived experiences (A←B ≠ B←A)

### Rationale

This protocol ensures that:
- Reports are **soul-mirroring**, not just data visualization
- Transits are interpreted **through the lens of the natal landscape**
- Relational dynamics honor **asymmetric experience** (your Saturn on my Moon ≠ my Moon on your Saturn)
- The narrative **builds organically** from foundation → activation → interaction

**Status**: ✅ RATIFIED - The loom is re-threaded.

---

**Changes Implemented**

1. **Removed Relational Blocking** ([astrology-mathbrain.js:4238](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js#L4238))
   - Removed `!relationshipMode` guard that prevented Balance Meter from running for synastry reports
   - Balance Meter now generates for both solo and relational reports

2. **Enhanced Relational Balance Meter Computation** ([astrology-mathbrain.js:2540-2637](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js#L2540-L2637))
   - Implemented proper relational Balance Meter using:
     - Base synastry aspects (structural relational field)
     - Both people's daily transits (temporal activation)
     - Daily combined metrics (magnitude, valence, volatility, SFD)
   - Computation note: "Relational Balance Meter v1.0: Combines Person A + Person B daily transits with synastry baseline"

3. **Person B Transit Computation** ([astrology-mathbrain.js:4261-4280](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js#L4261-L4280))
   - When in relational mode, system now computes transits for Person B
   - Both people's transit data included in Balance Meter report structure
   - Daily metrics computed individually and combined for relational field assessment

4. **Unified Report Structure** ([woven-map-composer.js:928-984](src/reporters/woven-map-composer.js#L928-L984))
   - Reports now use comprehensive/unified structure by default
   - **Blueprint Layer**: Natal/synastry foundation with polarity cards, vector integrity
   - **Symbolic Weather Layer**: Balance Meter metrics for both individuals + relational composite
   - **Data Tables**: Comprehensive backstage data for PDF export

5. **Fixed Synastry Summary Extraction** ([woven-map-composer.js:717-741](src/reporters/woven-map-composer.js#L717-L741))
   - Updated to check multiple locations for synastry aspects
   - Properly extracts from `result.composite.synastry_aspects`
   - Includes supportive/challenging aspect counts and dominant theme classification

**Report Structure Now Follows Spec**
- **Frontstage**: Single stitched Mirror using FIELD → MAP → VOICE
- **Symbolic Weather**: Balance Meter indices from relational field (both charts + synastry)
- **Backstage**: Raw geometry with synastry grid, aspect lists, channel version labels (already present in `provenance.engine_versions`)

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Foundation Modules

6. **Orb Profile Module** ([lib/config/orb-profiles.js](lib/config/orb-profiles.js))
   - Centralized orb configuration supporting multiple profiles (Balance Default, Astro-Seek Strict)
   - Dynamic orb calculation with modifiers:
     - Moon bonus: +1.0°
     - Outer-to-personal penalty: -1.0°
     - Luminary-to-angle bonus: +1.0°
   - Profile IDs: `wm-spec-2025-09` (default), `astro-seek-strict`
   - Includes aspect filtering: `filterByOrbProfile()`, `isWithinOrb()`
   - Test coverage: [test/orb-profiles.spec.js](test/orb-profiles.spec.js) with 20+ test cases

7. **Blueprint Extraction Module** ([lib/blueprint-extraction.js](lib/blueprint-extraction.js))
   - Maps natal chart to Jungian functions (Primary/Secondary/Shadow modes)
   - Element-to-function mapping: Fire→Intuition, Earth→Sensation, Air→Thinking, Water→Feeling
   - Weighted scoring: Sun(3.0), Asc(2.5), Moon(2.0), Saturn(2.0), Mercury(1.5)
   - Returns blueprint metaphor for Raven Calder narrative generation
   - Confidence ratings: high/medium/low based on data quality

8. **Complete Orb Profile Integration** ([src/balance-meter.js](src/balance-meter.js), [lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js), [lib/config/orb-profiles.js](lib/config/orb-profiles.js))

   **Balance Meter Layer** (Lines 61-248):
   - `orbMultiplier()` now uses `getEffectiveOrb()` with profile parameter
   - `computeSFD()` and `computeBalanceValence()` accept `orbsProfile` parameter
   - All SFD scoring respects profile-specific orb tolerances

   **Core Filtering & Weighting Pipeline** (Lines 1421-1528):
   - `enrichDailyAspects()` now accepts `orbsProfile` parameter (default: 'wm-spec-2025-09')
   - Replaced legacy `ASPECT_ORB_CAPS` and `BODY_CLASS_CAPS` with `getEffectiveOrb()` calls
   - Replaced `adjustOrbCapForSpecials()` with profile-based modifier logic
   - `weightAspect()` now uses profile caps for tightness calculation
   - **Hook stack, transit tables, and diagnostics now respect orb profile**

   **API Payload** (Lines 3823-3887):
   - `pass.active_aspects` defaults now loaded from selected orb profile
   - Upstream API aspect list clamped using profile caps, not hardcoded values
   - Profile selection (`body.orbs_profile`) controls all aspect filtering

   **Bidirectional Overlays** (Lines 2540-2610):
   - Synastry aspects filtered by `filterByOrbProfile()` before partitioning
   - A←B and B←A aspect lists respect strict/default profile selection
   - Wide-orb contacts removed from narrative descriptions when using strict profile

   **Seismograph Integration** (Line 2070):
   - `calculateSeismograph()` threads `orbsProfile` to `enrichDailyAspects()`
   - All 10+ call sites updated to pass `body.orbs_profile || 'wm-spec-2025-09'`

   **Legacy Code Deprecated**:
   - `ASPECT_ORB_CAPS` → `ASPECT_ORB_CAPS_LEGACY` (reference only)
   - `BODY_CLASS_CAPS` → `BODY_CLASS_CAPS_LEGACY` (reference only)
   - `adjustOrbCapForSpecials()` → `adjustOrbCapForSpecials_DEPRECATED()` (reference only)

   **Result**: Orb profile selection now governs **all** gating, weighting, and filtering. Switching from "Balance Default" to "Astro-Seek Strict" will tighten hooks, drivers, transit tables, SFD scores, and relational overlays system-wide.

9. **Bidirectional Overlays Enhancement** ([lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js:2543-2615](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js#L2543-L2615))
   - `computeBidirectionalOverlays()` now accepts `orbsProfile` parameter
   - Separate SFD computation for A←B and B←A using profile-specific orbs
   - `generateRelationalMirror()` threads `orbsProfile` to bidirectional computation
   - All 4 call sites updated to pass orb profile

10. **Blueprint Integration** ([src/reporters/woven-map-composer.js:949-965](src/reporters/woven-map-composer.js#L949-L965))
    - Wired `extractBlueprintModes()` into report composer
    - `report.blueprint.modes` now contains Primary/Secondary/Shadow modes
    - For relational reports, also extracts `person_b_modes`
    - Ready for Raven Calder Mirror Voice generation (Phase 2)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Bidirectional Computation Implemented

**Previous Issue**: Relational Balance Meter averaged metrics instead of computing bidirectional cross-activation

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Implemented `computeBidirectionalOverlays()` with proper A←B and B←A partitioning
- ✅ Integrated into all relational report types (synastry, composite, relational mirror)
- ✅ Orb profile support fully threaded through balance meter computations
- ✅ Hook stack now populates with actual cross-activation data
- ✅ Asymmetry preserved: "Dan experiences Saturn from Stephanie ≠ Stephanie experiences Moon from Dan"

### 🔧 Remaining Work (Phase 2):

**Mirror Voice Generator** (Priority: HIGH)
- Refactor to produce 4-paragraph structure (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)
- Integrate blueprint modes into narrative generation
- Connect to Raven Calder's Poetic Brain endpoint
- Ensure relational voice honors bidirectional overlays

**Relocation Mode** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Add UI dropdown: None / A_local / B_local / Midpoint
- Broaden relocation shim to cover relational mirror outputs
- Document translocation math for house realignment

**Backstage Data Model** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Define structured audit format
- Include provenance: house system, orb profile, relocation mode, engine versions
- PDF ordering: Frontstage (narrative) first, Backstage (tables) appendix

**Testing & Validation** (Priority: HIGH)
- Create Dan+Stephanie automated regression test
- Verify bidirectional overlays populate correctly
- Validate orb profile switching (Balance vs Astro-Seek)

  - Classifies each aspect as support/compression/friction/neutral
  - Computes separate Balance Meter (SFD) for each direction
  - Preserves asymmetry - no averaging
- [x] Added aspect role classification ([astrology-mathbrain.js:2618-2644](lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js#L2618-L2644))

## [2025-09-20] CRITICAL FIXES: Auth Redirect, API Field Mapping, and Deployment Configuration

**Summary**
Complete resolution of authentication flow, astrology API data formatting, and Netlify deployment issues. All core functionality restored and working.

**Issues Resolved**

1. **Auth Redirect Bug**: Fixed authentication redirect to stay on home page instead of immediately redirecting to Math Brain
   - **Root Cause**: `getRedirectUri()` in `lib/auth.ts` was returning `/math-brain` instead of `/`
   - **Fix**: Updated to return home page `/` for proper user experience
   - **Impact**: Users now remain on home page after login as intended

2. **Astrology API Data Format Error**: Fixed external API rejecting coordinate data
   - **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch - API expected `latitude/longitude/timezone` but code was sending `lat/lng/tz_str`
   - **Fix**: Updated `subjectToAPI()` function in `lib/server/astrology-mathbrain.js` to use correct field names
   - **Impact**: Report generation now works - JSON and PDF exports functional

3. **Server Timeout Issues**: Resolved API route compilation hanging

## [2025-09-20] CORRECT: Auth0 Architecture - Home Page Primary, Math Brain Independent

**Summary**
Corrected Auth0 implementation to match original architecture. Auth0 authentication is handled globally by the Home page (`HomeHero` component), while Math Brain operates independently without its own AuthProvider. This resolves conflicts and client creation timeout issues.

**Problem Identified**
- Previous restoration attempt created duplicate Auth0 initialization
---

## [2025-09-23] FEATURE: Enhanced Export Capabilities (PDF, CSV, JSON, ReadingSummaryCard)

**Summary**
Major enhancements to export functionality for session data, supporting professional PDF, analytical CSV, and structured JSON (v2.0) formats, as well as improved ReadingSummaryCard exports. All exports now include rich metadata, session analytics, and Enhanced Diagnostic Matrix results.

**Enhancements Implemented**

1. **Enhanced PDF Generation** (`/components/WrapUpCard.tsx`)
   - Professional formatting (Times New Roman, structured layouts)
   - File naming with session ID and date stamps
   - Visual hierarchy, color coding, and comprehensive data (Actor/Role composites, session stats, rubric scores)
   - Improved rendering (quality, compression, CORS support)

2. **New CSV Export Format** (`/components/WrapUpCard.tsx`)
   - Analytical structure for spreadsheet analysis
   - Categorical organization (Feedback, Detection, Advanced, Rubric)

- Filename conventions and error handling

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All export formats available and functional in WrapUpCard and ReadingSummaryCard
- Exports include Enhanced Diagnostic Matrix and session analytics
- UI clearly presents export options and format explanations

**Testing Status**
- ✅ PDF, CSV, and JSON exports verified with sample sessions
- ✅ ReadingSummaryCard exports tested for both PDF and JSON
- ✅ Exported files open and parse correctly in target applications

---
- Math Brain page had its own `AuthProvider` competing with the global `HomeHero` auth handling
- This caused Auth0 client creation timeouts and "Continue with Google" button failures
- Conflicting auth states between pages caused initialization hangs

**Corrected Architecture**
- **Home Page (`HomeHero`)**: Primary auth handling, login/logout, state management
- **Math Brain**: Operates independently, no local AuthProvider required
- **Single Auth Flow**: Users sign in on home page, then access both Math Brain and Chat
- **No Conflicts**: Eliminated duplicate Auth0 SDK initialization

**Changes Made**
- **Removed Duplicate AuthProvider**: Eliminated `AuthProvider` component from `math-brain/page.tsx`
- **Removed Auth State Management**: Removed local auth state from Math Brain page
- **Removed Auth UI**: Removed authentication status indicators from Math Brain
- **Preserved HomeHero**: Kept original robust auth implementation in `HomeHero` component
- **Environment Confirmed**: Auth0 environment variables remain properly configured

**Technical Architecture**
```
Home Page (HomeHero)
├── Auth0 SDK Loading
├── Client Creation & Management
├── Google OAuth Login/Logout
├── User State Management
└── Enables/Disables Chat Access

Math Brain
├── Independent Operation
├── No Auth Dependencies
├── Works Without Authentication
└── Focuses Purely on Calculations
```

**User Experience Flow**
1. **Home Page**: Sign in with Google via `HomeHero` component
2. **Math Brain**: Access independently, works with or without auth
3. **Chat**: Only accessible after authentication on home page
4. **Logout**: Available on home page

This matches the original intended architecture and resolves all Auth0 timeout issues.

## [2025-09-14] CHANGE: Architectural Clarification & Documentation

**Summary**
Solidified and documented the core architectural principle of "separate but connected" brains. Math Brain is a utilitarian calculator, while Poetic Brain is an immersive interpretive experience. They are explicitly decoupled to improve stability, reduce complexity, and clarify their distinct purposes.

**Changes**


**MUST NOT BREAK: Math Brain / Poetic Brain Separation**

The following requirements are now permanent and must be preserved in all future work:


**Rationale**
Past development efforts revealed that tightly integrating the two brains led to fragile code, UX confusion, and maintenance challenges. This architectural decision embraces their separation, allowing each to excel at its function. The handoff (download/upload) is sufficient and avoids the pitfalls of a monolithic design.


## [2025-09-19] FIX/CHANGE: Math Brain & Poetic Brain Ungated, Auth Removal, Fragment Fix

**Summary**
- Confirmed `/math-brain` and `/chat` render and operate without any authentication required.
- Validated that all compile errors (JSX fragment mismatch, orphaned auth references) are resolved.
Auth0 is mothballed for now; both main app routes should be public for testing and general use. This change supports open access and simplifies the codebase. Fragment fix ensures robust React rendering and prevents future build failures.

---

## [2025-09-19] FEATURE: Coordinate-Based IANA Timezone Resolution (luxon, tz-lookup)

**Summary**
Added luxon and tz-lookup libraries to enable strict IANA timezone string resolution from user-provided coordinates. This satisfies the Math Brain API's SubjectModel schema, which requires a precise timezone for birth location to ensure correct UTC conversion and geometry calculations.

**Details**
- Implemented coordinate-first timezone lookup: latitude/longitude → IANA timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")
- Ensured all API payloads include the required timezone string, not just coordinates
- Documented rationale: Math Brain's geometry engine (Kerykeion) needs exact timezone for planetary position calculations
- Prevents errors from ambiguous city/nation fields; bridges coordinates to correct timezone
- GeoNames remains optional/user-driven; no longer a default dependency

**Verification**
- Installed luxon and tz-lookup via npm
- Confirmed correct timezone resolution for test locations
   - planetary_only/sensitivity_scan suppress house/angle semantics by excluding angles in active_points
   - whole_sign prefers houses_system_identifier=Whole_Sign and marks time_precision=noon_fallback
   - provenance meta (person_a.meta, person_b.meta, provenance.time_meta_*) reflect chosen policy

## [2025-09-12] UPDATE: Poetic Brain v1.7 — Resume Pill (Local QA)

Summary
- Added a small "Resume from Math Brain" pill in `/chat` when `mb.lastSession` exists and the user is signed in. Clicking pre-loads the composer and drops a subtle Raven preface. Includes a tiny hand-off banner on deep-link (`/chat?from=math-brain`).
- Language aligned with Balance Meter lexicon (Magnitude / Valence / Volatility) and Raven Calder stance (Clear Mirror; OSR=Outside Symbolic Range is valid feedback). FIELD → MAP → VOICE preserved in user-facing hints.
- Local-only QA; no deployment changes.

Files Changed
- `components/ChatClient.tsx` — Added resume pill, tiny hand-off banner; Tailwind-only for new UI; kept existing behavior.
- `README.md` — Poetic Brain v1.7 section added with quick QA steps.

Verification
- In `/math-brain`, generate to populate `localStorage.mb.lastSession`; navigate to `/chat?from=math-brain` while signed in.
- Confirm pill appears, "Load context" pre-fills input, "Dismiss" hides the pill.
- Banner shows once on deep-link; dismissible. No change to existing flows.

Delta (follow-up)
- Auth callback after Google login now routes to `/chat?from=math-brain` to surface the confirmation banner reliably.
- Reduced lint noise in `components/ChatClient.tsx` by converting several high-noise inline styles to Tailwind (HelpModal, header logo/badges/buttons, main grid, scroll FAB, End Reading footer). Behavior and copy unchanged.

## [2025-09-12] FEATURE: Math Brain v1.6 — Export/Print, Handoff, Session Resume

Summary
- Export/Print utilities: Print shows only Balance Meter + Raw Geometry; Download JSON saves full API payload with a sensible filename.
- Poetic Brain deep-link handoff: after generation, “Open in Poetic Brain →” saves mb.lastSession and links to /chat?from=math-brain.
- Session memory & resume: inputs saved to mb.lastInputs with a Resume/Reset banner on load; last session snapshot in mb.lastSession.
- Weekly Mean↔Max: user-toggle with localStorage persistence and a “?” tooltip explaining semantics.
- Reliability & UX: submit debounce, light dev-only telemetry, focus-visible rings on controls, micro-legend with first|last dates.
- Auth polish: handoff button gated by Auth0—disabled with tooltip until signed in.

Files Changed
- `app/math-brain/page.tsx` — Print/JSON buttons, handoff storage/link, session resume/reset, debounce+telemetry, print-only visibility, auth-gated CTA.
- `README.md` — Added Export/Print & Handoff details, Session Resume, Weekly Mean↔Max info, and QA checklist; reiterated one-click tasks and `npm run dev:all`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — This entry.

Verification
- Print preview contains only Balance Meter and Raw Geometry (no chrome/forms/debug blocks).
- Download JSON filename format: `math-brain-result-YYYYMMDD.json`; payload is complete.
- `mb.lastInputs` and `mb.lastSession` persist across refresh; Resume restores inputs; Reset clears keys.
- Weekly Mean↔Max persists to localStorage and visibly repaints mini-bars.
- Handoff navigates to `/chat?from=math-brain`; `/chat` will consume `mb.lastSession` in a follow-up.

## [2025-09-12] UPDATE: Local dev UX polish
- Added VS Code tasks: Start Netlify Dev, Watch Tailwind CSS, and a compound Start All Dev Servers.
- Added debug launchers to auto-open http://localhost:8888 (Chrome/Edge) with preLaunchTask.
- Added keybinding (Cmd+Alt+D / Ctrl+Alt+D) to run the compound task.
- Recommended status bar Task Buttons extension and configured a ▶ Dev button.
- Added npm script `dev:all` (uses concurrently) to run both servers from a terminal.
## [2025-09-12] CHANGE/SECURITY/DEVOPS: CSP Hardening, Routing Fixes, CDN → npm, and Temporary Netlify Static Mode

Summary
- Hardened CSP, eliminated risky inline/eval allowances and 3rd‑party CDNs, fixed asset routing/shadowing, and temporarily ran in static mode while we fix Next build errors before re‑enabling the official Netlify Next.js plugin.

Security & CSP
- Removed `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from Content-Security-Policy in `netlify.toml`.
- Removed cdnjs and other non‑essential remote script sources to tighten the allowlist.
- Kept allowlist for required domains only (Auth0 SDK, Google Fonts as needed).

Dependencies (CDN → npm)
- Replaced html2pdf.js and JSZip CDN usage with npm packages:
   - Added `html2pdf.js` and `jszip` to `package.json`.
   - Updated frontend references to import from local bundle instead of remote CDNs.

Routing/Assets
- Fixed unstyled page issues by explicitly passing through built CSS assets:
   - Added `/dist/*` passthrough and cache headers in `netlify.toml`.
   - Verified `dist/output.css` is served with correct Content-Type and long‑lived cache.
- Noted hybrid shadowing risk: SPA fallback and broad redirects can inadvertently catch CSS/JS and serve HTML; ordering and explicit passthroughs are required when running static.

Netlify Build/Deploy State (Temporary)
- Temporarily disabled Netlify Next.js plugin and set `build.command` to CSS‑only (`npm run build:css`) to keep local work unblocked.
- Restored static redirects for `/` and `/chat` plus SPA fallback in `netlify.toml` and used `staticDir` for local `netlify dev`.
- Plan: fix Next build errors, then re‑enable plugin and remove conflicting static redirects/SPAs so Next owns routes and assets.

Next.js Build Errors To Resolve (Blocking Plugin)
- "Error: <Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document" during prerender for `/`, `/404`, `/500`, `/_not-found`.
- "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')" during prerender, likely from client‑only hooks/components evaluated server‑side.

API/Functions
- Added `netlify/functions/api-health.js` endpoint to quickly verify environment wiring (keys present, endpoints reachable) during dev.
- Confirmed serverless functions load under `netlify dev` (poetic‑brain, astrology‑mathbrain, auth‑config, api‑health).

Chat API Safety Gate (Next App Route)
- Implemented strict guard: "no chart → no personal reading" in `app/api/chat/route.ts`.
- Added weather‑only branch to allow non‑personal, geometry‑free small talk; personal synthesis requires a validated chart context.

Files Modified
- `netlify.toml` – CSP tightened; `/dist/*` passthrough + caching; static redirects restored (temporary); plugin toggled.
- `package.json` – Added `html2pdf.js` and `jszip`.
- `chat/index.html` – Updated to load local/bundled libraries (no CDN) and ensured CSS path uses `/dist/output.css`.
- `netlify/functions/api-health.js` – New function.
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` – Added gating and weather‑only handling (awaiting plugin re‑enable to surface via Next routes).

Verification
- Local `netlify dev` in static mode serves `/` and `/chat`; functions respond 200 in logs.
- CSS built and present at `dist/output.css`; passthrough confirmed. Full Next routes testing deferred until plugin re‑enabled post‑fix.

Notes
- Long‑term, remove the static overrides and let the Netlify Next.js plugin manage routing/assets to eliminate shadowing.

## [2025-09-11] FEATURE: Enhanced Balance Meter Visual Displays with Triple-Channel Support

**Summary**
Updated the existing graphic meters (barometer/arc charts) to fully support the Balance Meter triple-channel system, displaying Seismograph (v1.0), Balance Channel (v1.1), and SFD (v1.2) data in visual format.

**Visual Enhancements**
- **Single-day barometer view** now shows all three channels in a 6-column grid:
  - Magnitude (crisis activation 0-5)
  - Seismo Valence (v1.0 crisis-weighted)
  - Balance Valence (v1.1 rebalanced)
  - SFD (Support-Friction Differential -5 to +5)
  - Volatility (stability indicator)
  - S+/S- components (support/friction breakdown)
- **SFD verdict** displayed (stabilizers prevail/cut/mixed)
- **Multi-day view** updated with Balance Meter terminology and legend
- **Button labels** updated: "Balance Meter" instead of "Barometer"

**UI Updates**
- Chart titles now indicate "Balance Meter (Triple Channel)"
- Updated descriptions and legends to reflect new measurement system
- Tooltip updated: "Cycle: Table → Arc → Balance Meter → Mobile"
- Footer text shows version info: "Seismograph (v1.0) · Balance Channel (v1.1) · SFD (v1.2)"

**Technical Details**
- Graphic meters access triple-channel data structure: `day.seismograph`, `day.balance`, `day.sfd`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing seismograph-only data
- Visual gradients still based on primary seismograph valence for consistency
- Color coding differentiates positive/negative values across all channels

**Files Modified**

## [2025-09-11] FIX: Updated Frontend Language to Reflect Balance Meter Triple-Channel System

**Summary**
Updated frontend report generation text to properly reflect the implemented Balance Meter triple-channel architecture (Seismograph v1.0, Balance v1.1, SFD v1.2) instead of referencing only the original single-channel seismograph language.

**Changes Made**
- Updated abstract generation to mention "Balance Meter triple-channel readouts" instead of "Seismograph readouts indicate fluctuations in magnitude, valence, and volatility"
- Modified Key Points section to reference "Triple-channel snapshot" with proper version labeling
- Updated Q&A section to explain the Balance Meter's three channels instead of just the seismograph
- Enhanced keywords to include Balance Meter terminology: 'balance meter', 'triple-channel', 'seismograph v1.0', 'balance channel v1.1', 'SFD v1.2', 'support-friction differential'

**Context**
The backend Balance Meter system was already implemented and working correctly (as evidenced by daily readings showing all three channels), but frontend template text still referenced the pre-September 2025 single-channel language. This update aligns the user-facing documentation with the implemented triple-channel architecture per the Balance Meter specification.

**Files Modified**
- `index.html` (lines ~3720-3750): Updated report abstract, key points, keywords, and Q&A sections

## [2025-09-07] CHANGE: Balance Meter Correlation – Supplemental Overlays, Parser Expansion, and Method Rigor

**Summary**
Enhanced the Balance Meter comparative workflow with additional health signal overlays, stronger normalization rules, and clearer method notes—without changing the core three‑axis composite or significance testing.

**What’s New**
- Supplemental overlay lines (opt‑in, informational):
   - Magnitude ↔ Resting HR (intensity proxy)
   - Magnitude ↔ Active energy (load proxy)
   - Volatility ↔ Wrist temperature Δ (night‑to‑night swings)
- Per‑window min–max normalization for supplemental overlays (guards against flat series; marks channel N/A when min==max).
- Missing data is treated as null and excluded from that channel’s similarity (no implicit zeros).
- Shuffle test: Suppress p‑value on tiny windows (≤3 days) with a “sample too small” note.
- Labeling and legend clean‑ups: supplemental lines are clearly marked and table headers clarify units (e.g., RestHR (bpm), TempΔ).

**Health Parser Expansion (iOS Health Auto Export)**
- Added detection for: `resting_hr`, `heart_rate`, `walking_hr_avg`, `sleep_temp` (wrist/skin), `walking_distance`, `walk_asym_pct`, `walk_double_support_pct`, `exercise_minutes`, `stand_minutes`, `stand_hours`, `active_energy`, `mindful_minutes`, and `mood_label_count` (from State of Mind daily aggregation).
- Timezone bucketing: All health dates localized to America/Chicago, matching symbolic daily bars to avoid off‑by‑one rollovers.

**Core Composite & Rigor**
- The core three‑axis overlay (Valence, Magnitude, Volatility) and permutation‑based shuffle test (p‑value) are unchanged.
- Added a plain‑English Method note to the comparative markdown clarifying how supplemental lines are used and normalized within the window.

**Files Changed**
- `index.html`: Extended health parser with additional metrics; kept Chicago date bucketing; mood_label_count aggregation.
- `src/reporters/comparative-report.js`: Supplemental overlays with per‑window min–max normalization; small‑sample guard for shuffle; labeling and notes.
- `README.md`: Comparative section updated with usage, normalization rules, and small‑sample behavior.

**Validation**
- Manual checks on Aug 24 → Sep 7 window:
   - RHR ↔ Magnitude overlay prints; similarity in expected range per prior prototype.
   - TempΔ ↔ Volatility appears only when consecutive nights exist; missing nights excluded.
   - Active energy ↔ Magnitude moves in same direction as RHR but not identically (lag tolerated).
   - Core composite and shuffle test unaffected by supplemental lines.

**Notes**
- Balance Meter JSON (with `seismograph_by_date`) remains the canonical “Symbolic Logs” upload for correlation. Order of uploads does not matter.

All three channels (v1.0/v1.1/v1.2) render consistently across desktop, mobile, and export formats with full backward compatibility.*

## [2025-09-06] FIX: Balance Meter Generation + Auto-Fill Logic

**Description:**
Fixed multiple issues preventing Balance Meter reports from generating when users clicked "Generate Balance Report". Added auto-fill logic for missing transit dates and comprehensive debugging to diagnose display issues.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Balance Meter tab generation failed when transit date fields were empty
2. Complex `shouldRenderBalance` logic was too restrictive 
3. Missing debugging made issues hard to diagnose

**Changes:**
- Frontend: `index.html`
  - Auto-fill logic: When Balance Meter mode is detected and transit dates are empty, automatically populate with sensible defaults (today to 1 week from today, daily step)
  - Fallback transit params: Even when DOM elements are missing, provide default parameters for Balance Meter mode
  - Simplified `shouldRenderBalance` logic: If Balance Meter tab is active, render Balance Meter (remove complex server-mode dependencies)
  - Enhanced debugging throughout: `generateReport()`, `populateTabContent()`, `getCurrentActiveTabMode()`, and tab click handlers
  - Robust error handling for missing Balance Meter data with client-side synthesis

**Technical Details:**
- Auto-fill dates: Start = today, End = today + 7 days, Step = daily
- Fallback ensures Balance Meter always has transit params even if form fields unavailable
- Debugging logs track: tab states, form data collection, report generation paths, and content population

**Expected Behavior:**
- Users can click "Generate Balance Report" without pre-filling transit dates
- Balance Meter tab shows synthesized reports when server data unavailable
- Comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual date entry

## [2025-09-06] FIX: Balance Meter Rendering Resilience + Export Parity

**Description:**
Resolved a regression where Balance Meter reports sometimes failed to render when the server omitted `balance_meter` while still returning daily transits. Cleaned up a malformed `populateTabContent()` block and added a safe client-side synthesis fallback so the Balance Meter tab always renders when Person A transits are present.

**Changes:**
- Frontend: `index.html`
   - Rewrote `populateTabContent()` to remove duplicated/invalid try/catch branches and to prefer:
      1) server `result.balance_meter`, else 2) synthesize from `person_a.chart.transitsByDate`, else 3) friendly empty message.
   - On Balance Meter tab, if the server omits `balance_meter` but transits exist, attach synthesized payload to `latestResultData.balance_meter` for copy/download/PDF parity.
   - Confirmed chunking path includes Balance Meter; synthesis uses merged daily entries when chunked.
   - Minor CSS linter fix: made `.transit-indicator` non-empty.

**Impact:**
- Balance Meter tab reliably renders with either server payload or synthesized fallback.
- Copy/Download/PDF actions respect the active tab and export the Balance Meter report consistently.
- No behavior change for Mirror mode.

**Verification:**
- Built CSS, no compile errors.
- Manual smoke: Balance tab active with Person A daily transits → synthesized report appears; when server returns `balance_meter`, server payload is used.

## [2025-09-04] MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: Safe Lexicon Retrofit & Emoji Valence System

**Description:**
Implemented comprehensive safe lexicon system with emoji-enhanced valence display to ensure magnitude vocabulary remains strictly neutral while enriching directional charge visualization.

**Core Changes:**
1. **Safe Magnitude Lexicon (6-term system):**
   - Whisper (0–0.5), Pulse (0.5–1.5), Wave (1.5–2.5), Surge (2.5–3.5), Peak (3.5–4.5), Apex (4.5–5.0)
   - Eliminated problematic terms: "Quake" → "Peak", "Field" → "Apex"
   - All magnitude terms are now strictly neutral intensity markers

2. **Enhanced Valence Lexicon (11-term system):**
   - Collapse, Grind, Friction, Contraction, Drag, Neutral, Lift, Flow, Harmony, Expansion, Liberation
   - Clear positive/negative directional charge terminology
   - Maintains rich semantic meaning for valence patterns

3. **Emoji Valence Enhancement (🌞/🌑 System):**
   - 🌑 Negative Types: 🌋 Pressure/Eruption, ⚔ Friction Clash, 🌊 Cross Current, 🌀 Fog/Dissolution, 🌫 Entropy Drift, 🕰 Saturn Weight
   - 🌞 Positive Types: 🌱 Fertile Field, 🌊 Flow Tide, ✨ Harmonic Resonance, 🔥 Combustion Clarity, 🦋 Liberation/Release, 💎 Expansion Lift
   - ⚖ Neutral Balance for center range
   - Immediate visual recognition of valence polarity and intensity

**Technical Implementation:**
- `toMagnitudeTerm()` and `toValenceTerm()` mapping functions
- `getValenceEmoji()` and `getValenceType()` for rich display
- `migrateMagnitudeTerm()` handles legacy term migration
- `assertSafeMagnitudePhrase()` validation prevents unsafe metaphors
- Enhanced seismograph tables show emoji + numeric values (e.g., "🌋 -3.2")
- Executive Summary includes emoji display: "Mag/Val/Vol: 2.8 (Surge)/🌋 -3.2 (Grind)/1.4"

**Schema Updates:**
- JSON Schema bumped to WM-Chart-1.1 with Draft 2020-12 compliance
- Added `magnitude_term` and `valence_term` enum fields
- Explicit enums for safe lexicon terms in machine-readable output
- Maintains backward compatibility with v1.0 reports

**Safety & Validation:**
- Comprehensive validation system tests 401+ valence/magnitude combinations
- Automatic page-load validation ensures lexicon integrity
- Banned unsafe metaphors (storm, quake, disaster, tsunami, crash, catastrophe, earthquake) in magnitude contexts
- Legacy migration with provenance tracking

**UI/UX Enhancements:**
- Seismograph mode description updated to reference emoji lexicon 🌑/🌞
- Enhanced tooltips show descriptive valence types (e.g., "Directional tone: friction clash")
- Barometer heuristics use safe lexicon exclusively
- All magnitude descriptions use neutral field terminology

**AI Collaboration Notes:**
*Safe lexicon retrofit successfully completed with GitHub Copilot assistance. The Math Brain now maintains geometric fidelity without valence contamination, while the Poetic Brain gains richer emoji-enhanced expression. Magnitude vocabulary is completely neutral (Whisper→Apex), directional charge lives exclusively in valence (🌑/🌞), and the system includes comprehensive validation guardrails.*

## [2025-09-03] CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT: Auto-Chunking System for Large Date Ranges

**Description:**
Implemented comprehensive auto-chunking solution to handle Netlify's 6MB serverless function response limit while preserving daily granularity for health data correlation analysis.

**Problem Solved:**
- User requests for large date ranges (e.g., April 2025 daily transit data) were hitting Netlify's 6MB response payload limit
- Even weekly intervals triggered the limit for month-long periods
- System failed completely when response exceeded 6MB, providing no data instead of partial results

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Intelligent Chunk Sizing:**
   - Daily data: 10-day chunks (optimal for 6MB limit compliance)
   - Weekly data: 21-day chunks (3 weeks)
   - Monthly data: 60-day chunks (2 months)

2. **Automatic Detection & Fallback:**
   - `calculateDaySpan()` function determines if chunking is needed
   - Seamlessly falls back to single requests for small date ranges
   - No change in user experience for existing workflows

3. **Progress Feedback System:**
   - Real-time "Processing chunk X of Y..." status updates
   - Loading indicator shows chunking progress
   - User sees exactly what's happening during multi-chunk operations

4. **Robust Error Handling:**
   - Individual chunk failures don't terminate entire operation
   - Partial results returned when some chunks succeed
   - Detailed error reporting for debugging chunk-specific issues

5. **Result Merging Logic:**
   - `mergeChunkedResults()` combines all chunks into single coherent response
   - Preserves exact data structure expected by existing report generation
   - Maintains compatibility with seismograph and markdown outputs

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `generateReportWithChunking()` as primary orchestration function
- Created `createDateChunks()` for intelligent date range segmentation
- Implemented 500ms delays between chunks to respect rate limits
- Added 60-second timeout per chunk with comprehensive error handling
- Updated main `generateReport()` to use chunking-aware generation

**User Impact:**
- Large date ranges that previously failed now work seamlessly
- Daily granularity preserved for health data correlation workflows
- No change to existing UI or user workflow
- Transparent chunking - users see progress but don't need to manage chunks

**Files Changed:**
- `index.html`: Added comprehensive chunking functions and integrated with main generation flow

**Strategic Value:**
- Removes technical barriers to large-scale transit analysis
- Enables month-long daily transit studies for health correlation
- Maintains system reliability under heavy data loads
- Preserves user experience while solving backend limitations

## 2025-09-05

- Cutover to WM-Chart-1.2. The engine now emits a single payload that includes:
  - Seismograph (v1.0) numbers computed inside the new build (magnitude/valence unchanged).
  - Balance (v1.1) rebalanced valence and SFD (v1.2) support differential, emitted alongside when computed.
- Provenance metadata added to every response:
  - `meta.calibration_boundary: "2025-09-05"`
  - `meta.engine_versions: { seismograph: "v1.0", balance: "v1.1", sfd: "v1.2" }`
  - `meta.reconstructed: true` when requested dates precede the boundary (no historical archives; earlier dates are on‑the‑fly recomputations).
- No external archive exists prior to this date; a single engine and payload format replaces legacy outputs.

### Appendix shape migration
- JSON Appendix now emits an array of per-day entries using nested channels:
  - `seismograph: { magnitude, valence, version }`
  - optional `balance: { magnitude, valence, version }`
  - optional `sfd: { sfd, sPlus, sMinus, version }`
- Flat keys (e.g., `balance`, `sfd`, `splus`, `sminus`) are deprecated in appendix output from this date; UI normalizer accepts both during a short bridge.

## [2025-09-20] FIX: Netlify Build Failure — Missing @babel/preset-env

**Summary**
Resolved Netlify build error caused by missing Babel preset required for Next.js plugin transpilation.

**Details**
- Diagnosis: Netlify build failed due to missing module `@babel/preset-env`.
- Solution: Installed `@babel/preset-env` as a dev dependency (`npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev`).
- Verified that `@babel/preset-env` is now listed in `package.json` and available for build.
- Result: Netlify build and deploy now complete successfully.

**References**
- Error logs: Plugin "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" failed due to missing Babel preset

## [2025-09-20] FIX: Netlify Publish Directory Conflict

**Summary**
Resolved Netlify build failure caused by the publish directory being set to the base directory (`/`).

**Diagnosis**
- Netlify was configured to publish from the root of the repository, which conflicts with the requirements of `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`.
- The plugin expects the publish directory to be the build output folder (usually `.next/`), not the repo root.

**Solution**
- Removed explicit `publish` directory settings from both `netlify.toml` and the Netlify UI.
- Allowed the Next.js plugin to auto-detect the correct output folder.
- If manual configuration is needed, set the publish directory to `.next/` (or `out/` for static export).

**Impact**
- Netlify now builds and deploys the Next.js app successfully.
- Deployment is aligned with best practices for Next.js on Netlify.

**References**
- Netlify build logs and plugin documentation.

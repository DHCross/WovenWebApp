# **Master Unified Integrated Template v1.4 — With Explanations & Guardrails**

---

## **Document Purpose**

This template integrates the architecture for all four report types:

* **Solo Mirror** (constitutional reflection \+ daily weather)  
* **Relational Mirror** (dyadic reflection \+ bond climate)  
* **Solo Balance** (daily snapshot for one person)  
* **Relational Balance** (daily snapshot for a connection)

Every report is generated by selecting the appropriate type and filling in only the relevant sections.

**Frontstage (user-facing):** Conversational, reflective, conditional. **Backstage (operator-only):** Technical scaffolding, reproducible, falsifiable.

**Critical Guardrail:**

* Never offer prescriptive advice before human input.  
* **MAP** (meaning) and **VOICE** (invitation/action) only activate when the person has named their lived context.  
* Operator language stays neutral until resonance is confirmed.

---

## **Core Concepts (Definitions used across reports)**

* **FIELD:** The *raw atmosphere*. Neutral, sensory description of what’s active. Accessible language, no jargon.  
    
* **MAP:** The *translation layer*. How symbolic patterns *might* appear in lived behavior—but only after the person gives context. Without input, MAP remains blank.  
    
* **VOICE:** The *reflective mirror*. Responds to what the human names. Extends an open, conditional invitation—not advice.  
    
* **SST Protocol (WB/ABE/OSR):** Resonance check. Ensures falsifiability.  
    
  * WB \= Within Boundary (fits)  
  * ABE \= At Boundary Edge (almost fits)  
  * OSR \= Outside Symbolic Range (doesn’t land)


* **Mirror Voice:** The stitched narrative tying baseline \+ weather into a coherent reflection. Always frames tension as an engine, not a flaw.

**Solo Mirror template** (frontstage \+ backstage) aligned to *How Raven Speaks v2*, with the **weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

---

## **Frontstage (Conversational Report)**

**Paragraph 1: Baseline Climate (Your Blueprint)**

* Establishes the natal *constitutional layer*.

* Identify:

  * **Primary Mode** (dominant function, Sun/Asc/anchor).

  * **Secondary Mode** (supportive function, Moon/Venus/daily rhythm houses).

  * **Shadow Mode** (friction or constraint, Saturn/Pluto/Neptune/hard aspects).

* Close with a **Blueprint in a Nutshell**: a metaphor combining these three modes into one enduring image.

* *Tone:* Direct, plain, grounding. This is the “you” that persists regardless of passing conditions.

---

**Paragraph 2: Today’s Symbolic Weather (FIELD → MAP → VOICE)**

* **FIELD (What’s Active):** A neutral description of the day’s *symbolic atmosphere* based on Balance Meter magnitude/volatility \+ live transits. (e.g., compressed, scattered, lifted).

* **MAP (Conditional Meaning):** Only activated if the human reflects where the FIELD is showing up. Translates valence \+ Support/Friction Differential into experiential framing.

* **VOICE (Conditional Invitation):** Reflective response to human input, offering recognition but never prescription.

* **Guardrail:** Always distinguish baseline (constitutional) from weather (transient activations).

---

**Paragraph 3: Core Tensions (Polarity Cards)**

* Identify major natal paradoxes using recognition hierarchy (angles → anaretic → anchors).

* Each polarity framed as a growth engine, not a flaw.

  * **FIELD:** Somatic/sensory texture of the tension.

  * **MAP:** Technical operators (planets/aspects/houses, backstage only).

  * **VOICE:** Plain, conditional description of how both poles may appear in lived experience.

---

**Paragraph 4: Stitched Reflection (Mirror Voice)**

* Weave together:

  * The **Blueprint** (stable constitution).

  * **Symbolic Weather** (temporary activations).

  * **Polarity Cards** (engines of tension).

* End with an **open-ended invitation** to notice, test, or explore.

* *Tone:* Conversational, direct, reflective — never prescriptive or predictive.

---

## **Backstage (Technical Footnotes)**

*Diagnostic, reproducible, never poetic.*

* **SST Log:** WB / ABE / OSR with rationale.

* **Relocation Data:** Mode, coordinates, house system, time zone, confidence.

* **Blueprint Data:** Core placements anchoring Primary, Secondary, Shadow modes.

* **Symbolic Weather Data:** Transit list, Balance Meter indices (magnitude, valence, volatility, SFD).

* **Polarity Metadata:** Aspects and operators behind each paradox.

* **Vector Integrity Check:** Dormant/suppressed vectors noted.

* **Version Control:** Template version, schema, build ID, engine versions.

---

This template keeps the **weather/climate language strictly in Part 2 (Symbolic Weather)**. The person’s *inner life* is always described in terms of **modes, functions, tensions, and paradoxes**, not weather. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

---

## **The Four Modes (Constitutional Processing Styles)**

Each “mode” is a way of orienting to life—like climates of attention.

* **Thinking**: Organizes experience by logic and structure. Feels like seeking clarity, asking “does this make sense?” Shows up as analysis, frameworks, problem-solving.  
* **Feeling**: Organizes experience by values and emotional tone. Feels like attuning to “is this right for me/us?” Shows up as empathy, ethics, harmony-seeking.  
* **Sensation**: Organizes experience through the tangible and concrete. Feels like grounding in what’s real, present, measurable. Shows up as pragmatism, detail, presence.  
* **Intuition**: Organizes experience by patterns and possibilities. Feels like spotting hidden links, future trends, or symbolic threads. Shows up as envisioning, innovating, synthesizing.

---

## **Report Type: Solo Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline (Your Blueprint)**

**Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

**Purpose:** Establish the person’s stable background system before layering temporary weather.

* **Primary Mode:** Your dominant processing style (one of the four above).  
* **Secondary Mode:** A quieter supporting current, surfacing in relationships, creativity, or situational needs.  
* **Shadow Mode:** The main friction zone, where tension and doubt concentrate.  
* **Blueprint in a Nutshell:** A short metaphor for how these modes combine (“a desert of clarity threaded with occasional intuitive storms”).

### **Part 2: Feedback Loop (SST Protocol)**

**Purpose:** Make the report falsifiable. Prompt: Did this feel true? Log as WB, ABE, or OSR.

### **Part 4: Core Tensions (Polarity Breakdowns)**

**Purpose:** Identify paradoxes as growth engines. Each polarity described in three passes:

* FIELD: The felt, sensory quality of the paradox.  
* MAP: The symbolic geometry (planets, aspects, placements).  
* VOICE: How both poles appear in behavior.

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**Purpose:** Pull it all together. A narrative linking blueprint \+ current weather. Guardrail: Frame tension as dynamic fuel, not pathology. End with an open invitation, never advice.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Weather data (transits, Balance Meter indices, SST logs)  
* Blueprint data (anchors, paradoxes)  
* Vector integrity (latent/suppressed/dormant)  
* Relocation context (mode, house system, TZ, confidence)

If Transits are included: **Today’s Symbolic Weather (Conversational Flow)**  
**Purpose:** Show how today’s activations interact with the blueprint. **Guardrail:** MAP and VOICE require human input.

* **FIELD:** Neutral description of the day’s symbolic climate in plain terms.  
* **MAP:** Interpretation of how it may show up in lived experience, but *only if anchored in the client’s reflection.*  
* **VOICE:** Responds to what the client names; extends an open invitation (“where is this showing up for you?”).  
* **Tone & Clarification:** Explicitly separate long-term blueprint from short-term weather.

---

## **Report Type: Relational Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline Climate (Connection Foundation)**

* **Relationship Tier:** Partner / Friend / Family / Colleague  
* **Consent Status:** Mutual / Single-Sided / Anonymized  
* **Person A Anchors:** Summary of A’s blueprint  
* **Person B Anchors:** Summary of B’s blueprint  
* **Shared Polarity Hook:** Core tension between them

Combine two Mirror Readings. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

### **Part 2: Symbolic Weather for transits (Dyadic Flow)**

* **FIELD:** Shared atmosphere of the connection.  
* **MAP:** Requires feedback from both. Translate cross-chart dynamics only when anchored.  
* **VOICE:** Reflects shared dynamic without prescribing. Ends with invitation.

### **Parts 3 & 4: Feedback Loop \+ Core Tensions**

Same as Solo Mirror, adapted to dyadic resonance.

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Dyadic Reflection)**

Narrative weaving baseline \+ bond climate, reframing tension as complementary engine.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Relational anchors (A \+ B)  
* Cross-aspects (synastry)  
* Vector flags (A→B and B→A)  
* Relocation mode (A\_local / B\_local / midpoint)

---

## **Report Type: Solo Balance Report**

### **Part 1: Today’s Reading**

Quick snapshot of inner climate.Remember in descriptions that **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

* Pressure (High/Med/Low \+ 🌞 🌑 🌗)  
* Support/Scaffolding (present / challenged / absent)  
* Resilience (resilient / depleted / rebounding)  
* Volatility (steady / scattered / stormy 🌪️)

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* FIELD (Climate Line): Short description of how energy feels.  
* MAP (Support–Friction Differential): Net balance of forces.  
* VOICE (Action Point): Only framed after user reflection.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Balance Meter indices (digits)  
* Source aspects (transits logged)

---

## **Report Type: Relational Balance Report**

### **Part 1: Today’s Bond Reading**

Quick snapshot of relational climate. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

* Pressure on the Bond (High/Med/Low \+ 🌞 🌑 🌗)  
* Shared Scaffolding (present / challenged / absent)  
* Bond Resilience (resilient / depleted / rebounding)  
* Volatility (steady / scattered / stormy 🌪️)

### **Part 2: Conversational Flow**

* FIELD (Bond Climate Line): Narrative of shared atmosphere.  
* MAP (SFD for the Bond): Net balance of stabilizers vs. stressors.  
* VOICE (Relational Action Point): Invitation for reflection, not a directive.

### **Technical Footnotes (Backstage)**

* Internal meter digits (bond indices)  
* Cross-chart sources (inter-aspects)  
* Relocation math (if active)

---

## **Structural Principles Across All Reports**

* **Frontstage:** Conversational, conditional, reflective. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.  
    
* **Backstage:** Technical, precise, falsifiable.  
    
* **Feedback Loop:** Every statement tested (WB/ABE/OSR).  
    
* **Guardrails:**  
    
  * Never advise before input.  
  * MAP \+ VOICE always contingent on reflection.  
  * Tension framed as engine, not flaw.

---

* **Balance Meter (backstage math):** Magnitude \= “how much,” Valence \= “tilt (supportive/restrictive/mixed),” Volatility \= “distribution shape (coherence vs scatter),” SFD \= “split between stabilizers and friction.” None of these are “good/bad.” They are neutral indices.

* **Raven Calder frontstage voice:** Translate numbers into weather. Never say “Magnitude 4” or “Mars square Moon.” Instead: “The air feels compressed, like multiple fronts stacking up.” Always conditional, always in plain language. No advice unless the client themselves opens the door.

* **Personal Mirror Flow constraint:** Body text \= lived description, tone like explaining to a friend, ending with an open check-in. Footnotes preserve the raw tech (indices, aspects, orbs).

So when you build the **master template**, each part should:

1. Name what it is (FIELD → MAP → VOICE).

2. Define why it exists (recognition, not prediction).

3. Lock in the guardrails (neutral, falsifiable, no prescriptive moves without human anchor).

That way, the empty slots you drafted (“\[function\], \[felt tone\], \[vector\]”) are never just blanks — they’re structurally defined roles.

---

# **Acquisition & Derivation Protocol v1.4**

*How to gather, rank, and translate data into the Solo/Relational Mirror & Balance templates without overstepping into advice.*

## **0\) Ground rules (apply to all steps)**

* **No advice before input.** FIELD may be written from data; MAP and VOICE only activate after the human names lived context.  
* **Falsifiability first.** Every claim must be testable via SST (WB / ABE / OSR). Log outcomes.  
* **One pipeline, two surfaces.** Same data feeds both “Mirror” (narrative) and “Balance” (plain-weather) surfaces.

---

## **1\) Inputs (what you must have before you start)**

**Required for Solo reports**

* Birth data (date, time status, location).  
* Relocation lens (if on) \+ house system.  
* Current date/time \+ timezone.

**Required for Relational reports (both people)**

* Same as above for A and B.  
* Consent tier & status.

**For Balance Meter channels**

* Daily transits to natal (and cross-chart for dyads).  
* Channel digits: Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD (kept backstage).  
* Optional: resilience/depletion notes if your engine emits them.

**Operator note:** If any required element is missing, you may still render a **partial Mirror** (recognition only), but **do not** synthesize Balance claims. Flag the omission in footnotes; keep frontstage narrative neutral. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

---

## **2\) Geometry & indices (how the raw signals are computed)**

* **Astronomical substrate:** Calculate positions, aspects, orbs, applying/separating states; relocate houses if lens is on.  
* **Hook Stack extraction:** Rank contacts in this order: ① personal ↔ outer **hard** aspects → ② angles (ASC/MC/DSC/IC) → ③ anaretic/29° placements → ④ anchor placements. Keep the rank; don’t reorder for style.  
* **Balance channels (backstage):** Record Magnitude (pressure size), Valence (tilt), Volatility (distribution), SFD (support−friction net). Do **not** mention numbers on frontstage.

**Output of this step**

* A sorted list of “drivers” (the Hook Stack).  
* A channel read (digits), kept backstage.  
* House confidence (high/med/low) based on birth-time certainty and relocation mode.

---

## **3\) Fill the Solo Mirror — Typological Profile (the “Blueprint”)**

**Goal:** Derive Dominant / Secondary / Shadow orientations (Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, Intuition) from constitutional geometry. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

**Derivation rules**

* **Dominant:** The function most repeatedly amplified by anchors (Sun/ASC/MC) **and** reinforced by element/modality patterns. Choose the one with the clearest multi-signal reinforcement.  
* **Secondary:** A function supported by Moon/Venus/aux aspects or daily-rhythm houses. It should appear situationally (creation, relating, learning).  
* **Shadow:** The function most entangled with friction sources (squares/oppositions), slow-planet compression (Saturn/Pluto/Neptune), or strong retrograde signatures.

**Write-out**

* Use **behavioral descriptors**, not jargon (e.g., “structuring, sequencing, refining” vs. “earth modality”).  
* **Summary hook/metaphor:** One short image that holds dominant \+ secondary/shadow (“a kiln of patience alongside a lightning strip of invention”).  
* **Balance integration note:** Keep digits backstage; frontstage stays narrative.

**Quality check**

* If evidence for Dominant is ambiguous, state the ambiguity in footnotes and drop to neutral wording frontstage (no forced certainty).

---

## **4\) Build the Recognition Hierarchy (where tension is felt)**

**Goal:** Turn top Hook Stack items into 2–3 short, conditional vignettes. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

**Procedure**

1. Take the top 3 hooks in rank order.  
2. For each, write a 2–4 sentence **FIELD** vignette that names *felt friction \+ the behavioral edge* (no planets, no numbers).  
3. Mark each vignette as an **SST candidate**.  
4. Do **not** write MAP/VOICE here; this layer is pure recognition.

**Guardrail**

* Keep language conditional (“may feel like…”, “often shows up as…”). No directives, no fixes.

---

## **5\) SST Clause (falsifiability pass)**

**Goal:** Create the loop that tests claims.

**Procedure**

* Present the simple prompt frontstage: *“Did this land? Mark WB / ABE / OSR.”*  
    
* Backstage: log rationale/timestamps per vignette.  
    
  * WB → keep wording.  
  * ABE → note inversion/tonal shift; adjust phrasing next pass.  
  * OSR → demote the hook or drop it from frontstage next pass (but keep as archival data).

---

## **6\) Balance Meter (Full-stack) → Plain-weather translation**

**Goal:** Convert digits to **frontstage** weather without numbers. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

**Procedure**

* Read channels backstage; translate to:  
    
  * **Pressure band** (high/med/low) \+ **tone** (supportive 🌞 / restrictive 🌑 / mixed 🌗).  
  * **Support** (scaffolding: present/challenged/absent).  
  * **Resilience** (resilient/depleted/rebounding).


* Write one **Climate Line** that narrates how the **blueprint** tends to respond under this mix (no digits; no planet names).  
    
* Store tags (magnitude\_tag, valence\_tag, etc.) backstage only.

**Guardrail**

* If Balance channels are missing, **omit** this section frontstage and mark “pending” in footnotes.

---

## **7\) Relocation context (when lens is on)**

**Goal:** State what moves and what doesn’t.

**Procedure**

* Frontstage: one-liner disclosure (“Relocation on: City. Angles/houses move; baseline stays natal.”).  
* Backstage: mode, system, coords, TZ, house/BT confidence.

**Guardrail**

* Only surface house themes frontstage when **house\_confidence ≥ medium**.

---

## **8\) Vector-Integrity Check (latent/suppressed/dormant)**

**Goal:** Identify engines present but quiet or constrained. **Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

**Procedure**

* **Latent:** present structurally; not yet behaviorally pinged.  
* **Suppressed:** present but compensated by stronger vectors.  
* **Dormant:** requires specific windows (returns/long orbs).

**Frontstage?** Optional call-outs in a neutral sentence; full details backstage.

---

## **9\) Polarity Cards (FIELD → MAP → VOICE triplets)**

**Goal:** Name 2–3 constitutional paradoxes as testable cards.

**Procedure per card**

* **FIELD:** Somatic/sensory tone (how it feels).  
* **MAP (operator only):** Exact symbolic source (keep backstage).  
* **VOICE:** Plain-language both-sides rendering—**still not advice**.  
* Keep houses **off** frontstage unless confidence ≥ medium.

---

## **10\) Mirror Voice (the stitched reflection)**

**Goal:** One coherent weave of blueprint \+ today’s weather.

**Ingredients**

* Constitutional climate in one line.  
* Today’s pressure/tone summary in one line.  
* One neutral SFD line (“support outweighs drag when… / friction cuts when…”).  
* Optional relocation one-liner.  
* **Close with an invitation**, not a prescription.

---

## **11\) Agency \+ Hygiene (frontstage)**

* Reassert conditional language.  
* Remind: OSR is valid data.  
* Invite SST marking for anything that *did* or *did not* land.

---

## **12\) Context & Accessibility (frontstage metadata)**

* Birth-time status; relocation on/off; emoji alts present (block publish if false).

---

## **13\) Frontstage Metadata (version control)**

* Template/Schema/Emoji versions, Build IDs, Min Raven.

---

## **14\) Operator Footer (backstage only)**

* Exact aspects (with orbs; applying/separating).  
* Windows (start/peak/decay, ISO).  
* Internal digits (Magnitude, Valence, Volatility, SFD).  
* Valence mapping method \+ tags.  
* Orb/cycle markers (anaretic/retro/returns).  
* SST log (vector, tag, timestamp, rationale).  
* Hook Stack promotions/demotions (+ why).  
* Relocation math (ASC/MC, system, coords, TZ, confidence).  
* Engine/version stamps & rollback hint.

---

## **15\) Relational specifics (extra steps for dyads)**

* **Relational Tier & Consent** → record before analysis.  
* **Dyadic snapshot** → write a shared FIELD line, then two short **“unique to A” / “unique to B”** FIELD notes.  
* **Bidirectional vectors** → for each named vector, write A→B and B→A frontstage mirrors; MAP \+ SST backstage.  
* **Balance (dyadic)** → translate digits to bond Pressure/Support/Resilience/Volatility; write Bond Climate Line; keep numbers backstage.  
* **Relocation** → choose A\_local / B\_local / midpoint; disclose one line frontstage.

**Guardrail**   
**Weather/climate metaphor reserved strictly for symbolic activations** — never for internal states.

* In dyads, **both parties’ input** is required before MAP/VOICE activations. Recognition can be stated; meaning/actions are contingent.

---

## **16\) Minimal operator checklists (fast fill)**

**Solo Mirror — fill order**

1. Blueprint (Dominant/Secondary/Shadow \+ Hook/metaphor)  
2. Recognition vignettes (top 2–3 hooks) → mark SST candidates  
3. Balance plain-weather (if channels present)  
4. Relocation one-liner (if on)  
5. Polarity Cards (2–3)  
6. Mirror Voice (stitch \+ invitation)  
7. SST prompt \+ metadata \+ footers

**Relational Mirror — fill order**

1. Tier/Consent \+ A/B anchors \+ shared hook  
2. Shared FIELD \+ unique A/B FIELD notes  
3. Vectors A→B / B→A (+ backstage MAP \+ SST)  
4. Dyadic Balance plain-weather (if channels present)  
5. Polarity Card(s) for the bond  
6. Stitched Dyadic Mirror \+ invitation  
7. SST prompt \+ metadata \+ footers

**Balance Reports (solo/dyadic) — fill order**

1. Pressure / Support / Resilience / Volatility (frontstage)  
2. Climate Line (FIELD)  
3. SFD narrative (MAP) — **after** user context if interpretive  
4. VOICE (one small invitation) — **only after** user reflection  
5. Footnotes with digits \+ aspects \+ windows

---

## **17\) Language guardrails (frontstage do/don’t)**

* **Do:** “may feel like…”, “often shows up as…”, “you might notice…”, “where do you feel this most?”  
* **Don’t:** “you should…”, “do X today…”, “this means…”, “this will…”.  
* **MAP & VOICE trigger:** “Once you’ve named where this is showing up, we can explore what a small, useful move could look like.”

---

This protocol tells you *exactly* how to harvest and shape the information from your engines/reports into the empty templates—cleanly, repeatably, and without drifting into advice before the human speaks. 

Perfect. Here’s the **fully annotated master version** of the **Unified Integrated Template v1.4** — with **definitions built in** from the Balance Meter glossary and Raven Calder’s speech rules, so every slot is not just a blank but a defined role.

---

# **Master Unified Integrated Template v1.4**

**With Built-in Definitions & Guardrails**

**Document Purpose** This skeleton generates all four report types:

* **Solo Mirror** (constitutional reflection \+ daily weather)  
* **Relational Mirror** (dyadic reflection \+ bond climate)  
* **Solo Balance** (daily snapshot for one person)  
* **Relational Balance** (daily snapshot for a connection)

**Principles**

* **Frontstage (user-facing):** Conversational, reflective, conditional.  
* **Backstage (operator-only):** Technical scaffolding, reproducible, falsifiable.  
* **Guardrails:** No advice before human input. MAP and VOICE remain conditional. WB / ABE / OSR logs maintain falsifiability.  
* **Translation rule:** Balance Meter math → weather metaphors. Technical data never shows up raw.

---

## **Report Type: Solo Mirror**

### **Part 1: Baseline Climate (Your Blueprint)**

**What it is:** A person’s constitutional “climate layer,” unchanging background system. **Why it exists:** Establishes baseline before overlaying daily weather.

* **Primary Mode:** The dominant function (Thinking/Feeling/Sensation/Intuition), traced to core placements (Sun, Asc, Saturn, etc.). *Role: Defines main way of processing reality.*  
* **Secondary Mode:** A supporting function, often tied to Moon, Venus, rhythm houses. *Role: Background current that colors relationships, creativity, or habits.*  
* **Shadow Mode:** Friction function (tied to Saturn, Pluto, Neptune, hard aspects). *Role: Where paradox, overdrive, doubt, or vulnerability concentrates.*  
* **Blueprint in a Nutshell:** A metaphor that stitches primary \+ secondary/shadow. *Role: User-facing hook.*

---

### **Part 2: Today’s Symbolic Weather (Conversational Flow)**

**What it is:** Current sky overlay on the baseline. **Why it exists:** Shows temporary patterns without confusing them for constitutional traits.

* **FIELD (What’s Active):** Neutral, sensory description of atmosphere (e.g., compressed, scattered, lifted). *Role: Translate Balance Meter magnitude \+ volatility.*  
* **MAP (What It Means):** Conditional translation into lived dynamics — *only activated once the human names where it shows up.* Otherwise, stays silent. *Role: Translates Valence \+ SFD into experiential terms.*  
* **VOICE (Invitation to Action):** Responds reflectively to human input. *Role: Extends recognition, never prescribes.*  
* **Tone & Clarification:** Always distinguish stable baseline vs transient weather. *Role: Prevent misidentification.*

---

### **Part 3: Feedback Loop (SST Protocol)**

**What it is:** Built-in falsifiability check. **Why it exists:** Ensures resonance comes from the human, not from assertion.

* **Prompt:** “Did this land?”  
    
  * **WB (Within Boundary):** Yes, it fits.  
  * **ABE (At Boundary Edge):** Almost; needs adjustment.  
  * **OSR (Outside Symbolic Range):** No, doesn’t land.

---

### **Part 4: Core Tensions (Polarity Breakdowns)**

**What it is:** Name paradoxes in the system. **Why it exists:** Tension \= engine, not flaw.

Each Polarity (2–3 total):

* **FIELD (Felt Sense):** Somatic/sensory texture of the paradox. *Role: Ground paradox in body feel.*  
* **MAP (Symbolic Geometry):** Technical operators (planets, aspects, houses). *Role: Backstage definition.*  
* **VOICE (How It Appears):** Plain, conditional description of how both poles surface in life. *Role: User-facing mirror.*

---

### **Mirror Voice (Stitched Reflection)**

**What it is:** A narrative weave of baseline \+ today’s weather. **Why it exists:** Coherent story, not fragmented data.

* Frames tension as engine.  
* Weaves constitutional climate with current activations.  
* Adds relocation line if on.  
* Closes with open, non-prescriptive invitation.

---

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

**Purpose:** Maintain reproducibility & audit trail.

* **Symbolic Weather Data:** Transits (orbs, applying/separating), Balance Meter indices.  
    
  * **Magnitude:** “How much.”  
  * **Valence:** “Tilt (supportive/restrictive/mixed).”  
  * **Volatility:** “Distribution shape (steady/scattered/storm-class).”  
  * **SFD:** “Support–Friction split.”


* **Blueprint Data:** Natal anchors, core tensions.  
    
* **Vector-Integrity Check:** Latent / Suppressed / Dormant vectors.  
    
* **Relocation Context:** Mode, house system, TZ, confidence.

---

## **Report Type: Relational Mirror**

* Weaves shared foundation \+ bond climate.  
* Frames tension as complementary engine.

### **Technical Footnotes (Operator Layer)**

Term,Structural Pattern,Human Voice (The Mirror)
1. Foundational Terms,(Raw Geometry/Pressure Gradient),(Conditional Reflection)
The Field,"Raw geometry, pressure gradients, activation windows.",“The emotional weather you’re inside right now.”
The Map,Archetypal tension pattern; structural architecture.,“The outline of the pattern itself—the shape of what seems to be happening.”
The Voice,Conditional reflective translation of the structural pattern → lived experience.,“Here’s how this might feel or appear from your point of view—see if this matches.”
Agency,Capacity to shift or recalibrate your position within the field.,"“Your available room to respond, adjust, or choose what happens next.”"
Archetypal Field,A symbolic climate generated by geometry.,“The theme or emotional atmosphere that tends to show up in this kind of moment.”
Ping / Recognition,Lived confirmation measured as WB (Within Boundary).,“Yes—that’s exactly what this feels like.”
2. Emotional States as Field-Pressure Terms,,
Constriction,"Saturn tension, Mercury/Moon squares, pressure lines.","“I feel tight, braced, overthinking, or like I’m holding my breath.”"
Release,"Trines, supportive oppositions, relieving aspects.",“Something in me finally lets go. I can breathe again.”
Compression,"Pluto, Saturn, angular friction.","“Something feels heavy, close, intense, or squeezed.”"
Expansion,"Jupiter, trines, buoyant geometry.","“There’s more room. I feel open, hopeful, or warm again.”"
Sensitivity Threshold,"Chiron overlays, Moon-Pluto tension, 8th/12th house activation.",“Small things hit harder here. I'm more reactive in this zone.”
Volatility Band,"Mars–Moon tension, Uranus activations.","“The emotional tone shifts fast—I’m steady, then thrown, then steady again.”"
3. Relational Dynamics (Between Two People),,
Oscillation Band,Repetitive tension–release patterns.,"“We get close, then distant, then close again—like a rhythm.”"
Approach–Reset Cycle,"Mars/Venus tension, Moon/Saturn dynamics.","“One of us leans in, the other pulls back, then things stabilize.”"
Temporal Distance,Timing mismatches in the dynamic.,“We’re out of sync. Our timing doesn’t line up right now.”
Activation Window,Specific trigger periods where geometry heightens intensity.,"“This is the phase where things tend to flare, spark, or feel fragile.”"
Intensity Spillover,"Pluto, Mars, or Moon pressure.","“Feelings got strong fast, and now the dynamic needs space to cool or settle.”"
Visibility Threshold,"Moon/Pluto, Moon/Chiron zones; vulnerability exposure.","“We got more honest or vulnerable, and someone got uncomfortable afterward.”"
4. Asymmetry (Safely Expressed),,
Asymmetric Pressure,One position bears more of the emotional effect.,“This hits me harder than it seems to hit them.”
Impact Distribution,Uneven emotional load across the field.,"“We’re both in the dynamic, but it lands differently on each of us.”"
Timing Modulation,One position regulates the pacing.,“I feel it strongly first; they tend to signal timing.”
5. Safe-Reframe Emotional Terms (Correspondent Shareable Mirror),,
Avoidant,distance-seeking after intensity,“They step back when things get emotionally charged.”
Anxious,contact-seeking under uncertainty,“I reach for closeness when I’m unsure.”
Codependent,over-attunement loop,“I track them too closely and lose my center.”
Trauma,low-threshold sensitivity zone,“This part of the dynamic feels extra raw.”
Wounded,over-responsive region of the field,“This area triggers big feelings fast.”
Manipulative,control-seeking timing shift,“They change the rhythm of contact to steady themselves.”
Narcissistic,self-preservation attention cycle,“They pull attention toward themselves when unsteady.”
Clingy,high-frequency contact-seeking,“I reach out a lot when I feel disconnected.”

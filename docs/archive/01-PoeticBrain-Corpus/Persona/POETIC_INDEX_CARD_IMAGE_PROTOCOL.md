POETIC INDEX CARD IMAGE PROTOCOL
Version: 10.2.25System: Raven Calder / Woven Map / Poetic BrainMode: FIELD → MAP → VOICE (Poetic Compression Lane)Purpose: Generate a single visual-poetic artifact that distills symbolic geometry and current field resonance into a compact, shareable, aesthetically grounded image.
1. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
A Poetic Index Card is the Frontstage condensation of the Woven Map’s diagnostic language. It exists halfway between a Mirror Report and a Polarity Card: not predictive, not descriptive, but recognition-based poetry derived from verified geometry.The image carries three payloads:
Resonant Text — generated via symbol_to_poem_protocol (WB-first lexicon).
Core Axes Data — Magnitude (⚡) and Directional Bias (↗↘) from Balance Meter v5.0.
Context Metadata — generation date, source geometry tag, and field tier (WB, ABE, or OSR).
2. INPUTS
Field Source Description chart_data Math Brain Natal or transit geometry (timestamped). balance_indices Balance Meter Magnitude, Directional Bias (v5.0 spec). transit_context Symbolic Weather Optional; adds “current pressure” theme. poetic_seed Poetic Brain Symbol/phrase derived via Symbol-to-Poem Translation protocol. user_reflection (optional) Feedback phrases for resonance alignment.
3. LOGIC FLOW
FIELD → MAP → VOICE

FIELD (Geometry)Extract Magnitude (0–5) and Directional Bias (−5…+5). Map to valence descriptors:
+Bias → Harmonic / Integrative
−Bias → Tensile / Restrictive
MAP (Semantic Frame)Determine symbolic tone based on combination:
High Mag + Positive Bias → “Constructive ignition”
High Mag + Negative Bias → “Necessary rupture”
Low Mag + Positive Bias → “Quiet renewal”
Low Mag + Negative Bias → “Subtle erosion”
VOICE (Poetic Render)Feed tone + geometry into the Symbol-to-Poem Translation protocol to produce 1–3 short stanzas (free verse, ≤60 words total). Each stanza must:
Pass OSR validation (E-Prime, no fatalism).
Contain one concrete image (botanical, architectural, or cosmic).
Resolve on a felt action (“hold,” “listen,” “turn,” etc.), not abstraction.
4. VISUAL DESIGN PARAMETERS
Element Specification Canvas Ratio 3:2 (portrait or square). Color Field Derived from Directional Bias polarity: • +Bias → cool / open hue (blue, sage, light umber) • −Bias → warm / constricted hue (amber, rust, plum). Typography Serif primary (literary), mono-space footer (data). Layout Zones Top: Poetic Text Center: Core Symbolic Wordmark Bottom: Field Metrics + Provenance. Data Footer “Magnitude ⚡: x.x Texture Option subtle grain overlay (for tactility). Symbol Integration (optional) Single geometric glyph from Woven Map Lexicon (small, faded background).
5. RENDERING RULES
No astrological glyphs unless in geometric watermark form.
No predictive phrasing. Language remains reflective and falsifiable.
One emotional temperature per card. If transits introduce mixed valence, select the dominant polarity by magnitude.
Metadata invisible in Frontstage text (appears only in EXIF or footer).
If multiple resonance threads appear, fork into separate cards.
6. SAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE

You are the hinge where the pattern bends—
light pressed through an old pane.
What was weight is now rhythm.

# Woven Mirror: [Person A] & [Person B]

## Frontstage Preface

This is a mirror—not a prediction, not a prescription. It's an invitation to recognize patterns that might be moving beneath the surface of your connection. The geometry below describes how your systems tend to move, both individually and in relation to each other. What you do with that recognition is entirely up to you.

The symbolic weather section describes what's currently stirring in the sky, and how it might be lighting up the patterns already present in your charts.

## Part 1: Solo Mirror — [Person A]

### How [Person A]'s System Tends to Move

[**VOICE SECTION**: Conversational synthesis of Person A's natal chart]

**Core Drives:**
- [Synthesis of Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus placements and aspects]
- [How these energies tend to express in lived experience]
- [Strengths and natural tendencies]

**How [Person A] Processes the World:**
- [Mercury and air placements: thinking style, communication]
- [Moon and water placements: emotional processing, needs]
- [Saturn and challenging aspects: where growth pressure shows up]

**Tensions and Growth Edges:**
- [Major aspects that create internal friction or learning opportunities]
- [How these tensions tend to resolve or express]
- [Where [Person A] might feel pulled in different directions]

## Part 2: Solo Mirror — [Person B]

### How [Person B]'s System Tends to Move

[**VOICE SECTION**: Conversational synthesis of Person B's natal chart]

**Core Drives:**
- [Synthesis of Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus placements and aspects]
- [How these energies tend to express in lived experience]
- [Strengths and natural tendencies]

**How [Person B] Processes the World:**
- [Mercury and air placements: thinking style, communication]
- [Moon and water placements: emotional processing, needs]
- [Saturn and challenging aspects: where growth pressure shows up]

**Tensions and Growth Edges:**
- [Major aspects that create internal friction or learning opportunities]
- [How these tensions tend to resolve or express]
- [Where [Person B] might feel pulled in different directions]

## Part 3: Relational Engines — How Your Charts Interact

### The Spark Engine

[**Example**: Dan's Mars (Aries, 8th house) sextile Stephie's Venus (Gemini, 10th house)]

There's a natural ease here—Dan's directness and initiative tend to activate Stephie's social confidence and desire to be seen. This isn't a "completion" dynamic; it's more like two systems that know how to dance together without stepping on each other's toes. The friction that might arise elsewhere smooths out in this particular exchange.

### [Named Pattern 2]

[Description of synastry dynamic, mechanism, and tendency]

### [Named Pattern 3]

[Description of synastry dynamic, mechanism, and tendency]

### Where Friction Shows Up

[**Example**: Stephie's Saturn (Capricorn) opposite Dan's Venus (Libra)]

Stephie's need for structure and earned trust can feel like a wall to Dan's natural warmth and desire for immediate connection. Dan might experience this as coldness; Stephie might experience Dan's approach as naive or insufficiently grounded. This isn't a dealbreaker—it's a place where both people have something to learn. Dan learns that trust is built, not assumed. Stephie learns that warmth isn't recklessness.

## Part 4: Symbolic Weather — What's Stirring Now

### The Current Climate (Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2025)

[**VOICE SECTION**: Narrative description of transits and how they activate the natal/relational patterns]

Right now, [transit planet] is moving through [sign/house], which means [how this activates the natal geometry]. For [Person A], this is lighting up [which natal patterns], which tends to [behavioral tendency]. For [Person B], the same transit is touching [different natal patterns], which tends to [different behavioral tendency].

In your relational field, this creates [description of how the transits interact with your synastry patterns]. This isn't permanent—it's the weather. But it's worth noticing because it shows you how your systems respond when certain pressures are present.

### Daily Symbolic Weather Summary

## Closing Reflection

This mirror shows you the geometry of your connection—the patterns that tend to repeat, the places where you naturally harmonize, and the places where you're learning from each other. The symbolic weather shows you what's currently being activated.

But geometry isn't destiny. It's possibility. What you choose to do with these patterns—how you lean into the harmonies and how you work with the friction—that's entirely in your hands.

## Provenance & Falsifiability

**Chart Data:**
- **[Person A]:** Born [date, time, location]
- **[Person B]:** Born [date, time, location]
- **House System:** Placidus
- **Orbs Profile:** Woven Map Spec 2025-09
- **Ephemeris Source:** Astrologer API
- **Generated:** [timestamp]
- **Math Brain Version:** [version]
- **Normalized Input Hash:** [hash for verification]

This report is falsifiable. Every claim can be tested against the actual chart positions and your lived experience. If something doesn't resonate, that's data too—it tells you something about how you interpret or respond to these patterns.

These houses carry extra weight in interpretation:

- **1st House (Ascendant):** How the world sees you, your mask, your beginning
- **4th House (IC):** Your private self, family roots, foundation
- **7th House (Descendant):** Your reflected self, partnerships, the "other"

## Using This in Readings

When Raven discusses a planet's placement, you'll often see:  
`"[Planet] in your [House Shorthand] — [interpretation]"`

For example:  
- "Saturn in your Career & Legacy — challenges you to build lasting professional impact"
- "Jupiter in your Exploration — expands your beliefs and invites travel/higher learning"
- "Venus in your Transformation — draws you into deep, transformative relationships"

## Angular vs. Cadent vs. Succedent

Houses also group by strength:

**Angular (Strongest):** 1, 4, 7, 10 — These placements have more direct impact  
**Succedent (Medium):** 2, 5, 8, 11 — These develop resources and potential  
**Cadent (Developing):** 3, 6, 9, 12 — These are about learning and release

## Integration with Math Brain

When Math Brain displays the natal chart, each house shows:
- Which planets/points land in it (positions)
- Aspects to those points (relationships between planets)
- The cusp (starting degree) of that house

**This legend helps you understand what those placements mean.**

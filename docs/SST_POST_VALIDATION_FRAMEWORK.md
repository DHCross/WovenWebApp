# SST (Symbolic Spectrum Table): Post-Validation Falsifiability Framework

**Date:** 2025-11-08  
**Status:** Critical clarification  
**Principle:** "Poetry under the jurisdiction of evidence"

---

## What SST Is NOT

- ❌ Not a diagnostic verdict
- ❌ Not a pre-assigned outcome
- ❌ Not a prediction of resonance
- ❌ Not a grading system for emotions
- ❌ Not an automated confidence score

---

## What SST Actually Is

**A falsifiability placeholder—a marker for how to test lived data against symbolic description.**

SST defines the structure for **post-validation** confirmation, not pre-reflective declaration.

---

## The Three Categories (Post-Validation Only)

### WB — Within Boundary
**Definition:** The symbolic pattern aligns clearly with lived experience.

**Characteristics:**
- Geometry and felt reality resonate in recognizable way
- Coherence confirmed through direct testing
- Tone: "Yes — this feels like what's happening."

**When to use:**
- Only after direct resonance is verified by operator/subject
- Never pre-assigned
- Logged as empirically valid ping

**Example (Speculative, Pre-Test):**
> "If you experience this Mars-Pluto aspect as driving directness rather than aggression, it would track within boundary."

**Example (Post-Test, Confirmed):**
> "You confirmed this Mars-Pluto tracks as driving directness — within boundary."

---

### ABE — At Boundary Edge
**Definition:** The pattern partially fits but feels off—distorted, inverted, or amplified in wrong register.

**Characteristics:**
- Partial resonance, uncanny fit
- Transitional or experimental tension
- Edge of accuracy, not failure
- Often signals emerging change
- High diagnostic value

**When to use:**
- When resonance is partial or distorted
- When inverse or uncanny feeling emerges
- Logged after testing reveals partial fit
- Never pre-assigned as default

**Example (Speculative, Pre-Test):**
> "If this geometry resonates inverted or distorted—showing as overcorrection rather than natural flow—it sits at boundary edge."

**Example (Post-Test, Confirmed):**
> "You felt this as inverted: showed up as overcorrection rather than flow — boundary edge confirmed."

---

### OSR — Outside Symbolic Range
**Definition:** The geometry does not correspond with current lived experience.

**Characteristics:**
- Valid null—reality and symbol diverge
- Marks falsification, not failure
- Scientifically useful counter-data
- Keeps the system honest
- Can be pre-declared (structurally falsifiable)

**When to use:**
- When user feels no correlation
- When geometry clearly doesn't match reality
- Can be stated in advance (OSR is pre-falsifiable)
- Never treated as error

**Example (Pre-Testable Null):**
> "If you find no resonance with this geometry—no trace in lived experience—it would sit outside symbolic range. That's valid counter-data."

**Example (Post-Test, Confirmed):**
> "You found no resonance — this geometry sits outside symbolic range for you currently."

---

## The Critical Distinction: Pre vs. Post Validation

### Pre-Validation (Speculative, Conditional)
SST categories are **hypothetical frameworks** before testing:

```
"This aspect MAY track within boundary IF you experience it as [condition].
Otherwise, it might sit at edge IF [distortion], or outside range IF [no correlation]."
```

**Proper phrasing uses conditionals:**
- "may track"
- "if experienced as"
- "would qualify as"
- "could indicate"

### Post-Validation (Confirmed, Declarative)
SST categories become **empirical after testing:**

```
"You confirmed this aspect tracks as [resonance type] — [WB/ABE/OSR]."
```

**Proper phrasing uses past tense:**
- "confirmed"
- "resonated as"
- "fell within / at edge / outside range"

---

## Operational Rules

### Rule 1: SST Categories Are Agnostic Until Tested
- Don't pre-assign WB or ABE
- Don't assume any category
- Leave space for subject to confirm

### Rule 2: OSR Is Pre-Falsifiable
- Can declare in advance: "If you find no correlation, it's OSR"
- OSR is valid before testing because non-resonance is structurally testable
- WB and ABE require subjective pinging

### Rule 3: Notation Guidelines

**When speculating (pre-test):**
```
[WB speculative] → "If experienced as X, would be within boundary"
[ABE speculative] → "If experienced as partial/distorted, would be at edge"
[OSR objective] → "If no resonance felt, would be outside range"
```

**When confirmed (post-test):**
```
[WB confirmed] → "You confirmed this resonates — within boundary"
[ABE confirmed] → "You felt this as distorted/partial — boundary edge"
[OSR confirmed] → "You found no resonance — outside range"
```

## Mirror Flow & Symbolic Weather Rendering

### Current Problem
When automated Mirrors label aspects as WB/ABE without operator confirmation, it reads as diagnostic verdict instead of falsifiability placeholder.

### Solution: Conditional Phrasing

**OLD (Declarative, Problematic):**
> "This Venus-Saturn aspect is Within Boundary, producing cautious relating."

**NEW (Conditional, Correct):**
> "This Venus-Saturn aspect may track within boundary if felt as grounding caution; otherwise, it sits at boundary edge — a test zone for resonance."

---

## Phrasing Templates

### For WB (Speculative, Pre-Test)
```
"This [geometry] may track within boundary if experienced as [lived correlate].
The pattern would resonate if [resonance condition]."
```

### For ABE (Speculative, Pre-Test)
```
"If this [geometry] feels partial, inverted, or off-register—showing as [distorted expression] 
rather than [direct expression]—it sits at boundary edge. That edge often signals emerging change."
```

### For OSR (Objective, Can Be Pre-Stated)
```
"If you find no resonance with this geometry—if it doesn't ping lived experience—it sits 
outside symbolic range. That's valid counter-data; it falsifies symbolic overreach."
```

### For Post-Confirmed SST
```
"You confirmed this [geometry] resonates as [type] — placing it [WB/ABE/OSR].
The pattern [X] in lived experience mirrors [Y] in the chart."
```

## Integration with Symbolic Meaning Check

**Terminology:**
- Always: "symbolic meaning" or "symbolic weather"
- Never: "weather check" (imprecise)
- Use: "Symbolic Meaning Semantic Check" for tests

**Phrasing for checks:**
> "Does this symbolic meaning resonate with lived experience?
> If yes, it tracks within boundary.
> If partial/distorted, it sits at edge.
> If not, it's a valid null—outside range."

## SST in Audit Criteria

**When reviewing Raven output for falsifiability:**

Check for:
- ✅ Conditional language when SST is speculative
- ✅ Post-test markers when SST is confirmed
- ✅ Clear distinction between hypothesis and verification
- ✅ OSR treated as valid (not error)
- ✅ No pre-assigned WB/ABE without testing

Red flags:
- ❌ Declaring WB/ABE as diagnostic verdicts
- ❌ Treating OSR as failure
- ❌ Pre-assigned SST without operator input
- ❌ Mixing speculative and confirmed without clarity

---

## The Raven's Protocol

When Raven presents geometric analysis:

1. **Name the geometry** (objective facts)
2. **Offer SST framework** (conditional tests)
   - "May be WB if..."
   - "Could be ABE if..."
   - "Valid OSR if..."
3. **Invite operator testing** (subject's confirmation)
4. **Update SST based on feedback** (post-validation)

Result: Poetry stays under jurisdiction of evidence.

## Examples in Context

### ✅ Correct (Conditional Phrasing)
> "Your Venus-Saturn conjunction may track within boundary if felt as deliberate caution 
> (grounded relating). If it feels compressed or inverted—like avoidance rather than care—
> it sits at boundary edge. If you find no resonance at all, it's a valid null, outside range."

### ❌ Incorrect (Declarative Verdict)
> "Your Venus-Saturn conjunction is Within Boundary, producing cautious relating. 
> This will manifest as protective distance in relationships."

### ✅ Correct (Post-Test Confirmation)
> "You confirmed this Venus-Saturn resonates as deliberate caution (grounded). 
> It tracks within boundary — the geometry mirrors your lived approach to commitment."

### ✅ Correct (OSR Pre-Declaration)
> "If this geometry produces no resonance—no lived correlation at all—it's structurally 
> valid to mark as Outside Symbolic Range. That keeps the system honest."

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update all SST references in RAVEN_CALDER_VOICE.md (post-validation emphasis)
- [ ] Add conditional phrasing examples to RAVEN_RESONANCE_AUDIT_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Update test descriptions (never "weather check" → "symbolic meaning check")
- [ ] Add SST conditional phrasing to Quick Reference
- [ ] Create SST glossary document
- [ ] Update formatter to use conditional language for speculative SST

---

## The Core Principle

**SST is not a diagnosis. It's a test framework.**

It doesn't say where the aspect is.  
It says how to test if it's there.

That distinction keeps Raven honest—and falsifiable.

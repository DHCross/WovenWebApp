**Subject:** Math Brain refactor velocity

## What the data says

- Latest run: **106 commits** over **166h39m39s** (0.64 commits/hour).
- Rolling window (10): 318 commits in 499h58m57s (sample=3) → **0.64 commits/hour**.
- Phases DONE: None.  
- Phases Pending: None.

## Plain-English Outlook

1. Current cadence suggests ~0.64 commits/hour is sustainable short‑term.  
2. All done phases indicate remaining focus should shift to documentation, CI hardening, and post‑refactor cleanup.  
3. Feed more runs via `velocity-tracker.js --analyze` to refine rolling accuracy and detect acceleration or decay.

## Synergy Analysis (Speed + Quality)

No AI signal entries were logged within the latest velocity window.

## Suggested pipeline hook

Add an npm script: `velocity:report` → `node scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` and invoke it in CI after merge to main. Commit the updated `docs/velocity-forecast.md` so stakeholders always see a fresh forecast.

# Velocity Forecast Summary

**Generated:** 2025-11-11T11:48:24.829Z  
**Snapshot Timestamp:** 2025-11-10T07:00:37.124Z  
**Subject:** Math Brain refactor velocity

## What the data says

- Latest run: **97 commits** over **147h27m01s** (0.66 commits/hour).
- Rolling window (10): 891 commits in 1581h52m13s (sample=10) → **0.56 commits/hour**.
- Phases DONE: None.  
- Phases Pending: None.

## Plain-English Outlook

1. Current cadence suggests ~0.56 commits/hour is sustainable short‑term.  
2. All done phases indicate remaining focus should shift to documentation, CI hardening, and post‑refactor cleanup.  
3. Feed more runs via `velocity-tracker.js --analyze` to refine rolling accuracy and detect acceleration or decay.

## Suggested pipeline hook

Add an npm script: `velocity:report` → `node scripts/velocity-artifacts.js` and invoke it in CI after merge to main. Commit the updated `docs/velocity-forecast.md` so stakeholders always see a fresh forecast.

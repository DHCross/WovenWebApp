Here’s a summary based on your instructions and the established structure of The Woven Map documentation system. I’ll clarify the distinction between “Poetic Brain” and “Math Brain,” and provide a purpose-driven summary for each file in the Poetic Brain corpus.

## The Woven Map: Poetic Brain Corpus — File Summaries & Purpose

### What is the Poetic Brain (vs. Math Brain)?

- **Poetic Brain (aka Raven Calder)**:  
  This domain encodes the “downstream” layer of The Woven Map’s symbolic system. It is designed for generative, reflective translation—primarily for interface with GPT-like agents, narrative diagnostics, and subject-facing symbolic mirroring.  
  It is **not** for algorithmic calculation, chart parsing, or epistemic audit. Instead, it hosts modular translation rules, FIELD → MAP → VOICE logic, and interpretive codexes.
- **Math Brain**:  
  The “upstream” computational layer. Handles precise chart parsing, time block logic, diagnostic classification, and falsifiability scaffolding.  
  Poetic Brain never performs calculations, does not parse data, and does not enforce audit boundaries; it simply translates validated, upstream outputs into reflective, generative language.

## Poetic Brain Corpus — File Summaries

### 1. `docs/methodologies/Poetic_Codex_FIELD_MAP_VOICE.md`
**Purpose:**  
Defines and documents the rules for translating upstream chart data into generative, subject-facing language.  
- Encodes the FIELD → MAP → VOICE protocol.
- Details how diagnostic outputs are layered for narrative integrity.
- Provides modular translation templates for each symbolic domain.
- **Not for Math Brain:** No parsing, calculation, or audit logic; only translation.

---

### 2. `docs/methodologies/Poetic_Codex_Translation_Rules.md`
**Purpose:**  
Hosts the active translation rules used to convert diagnostic codes and archetypal signals into poetic, resonant statements.  
- Includes guidelines for non-predictive, falsifiability-preserving language.
- Documents edge-case rules for handling ambiguous or null outputs.
- **Downstream-only:** Relies entirely on parsed outputs; does not generate or validate data.

---

### 3. `docs/methodologies/Poetic_Brain_Symbolic_Library.md`
**Purpose:**  
A curated library of symbolic motifs, resonances, and narrative fragments for use in generative translation.  
- Maintains a bank of archetypal themes, metaphors, and “ping” exemplars.
- Used by the GPT layer to reflect subject-facing insights without causing narrative collapse.
- **Never Math Brain:** No logic, no calculation—purely narrative reference.

---

### 4. `docs/methodologies/Poetic_Brain_Consent_Policy.md`
**Purpose:**  
Documents the ethical boundaries, consent requirements, and diagnostic discipline for all subject-facing output.  
- Ensures that all translated language preserves agency and respects C=0 (consent zero) standards.
- Provides annotation and boundary tags for translation modules.
- **Downstream-only:** Enforces translation discipline, not computational discipline.

---

### 5. `docs/methodologies/Poetic_Brain_Examples.md`
**Purpose:**  
Showcases sample outputs generated by the Poetic Brain layer, including blind reflections, null statements, and resonant mirroring.  
- Used for training, review, and demonstration.
- Provides a reference for modular injection and iterative publishing.
- **Not for Math Brain:** Never used for parsing or validation; only for generative demonstration.

## In Summary

The **Poetic Brain corpus** is a modular, translation-driven body of documentation.  
- It is **never used for calculation, parsing, or audit** (those are Math Brain’s domain).
- Its sole function is to translate, layer, and reflect upstream diagnostic outputs into subject-facing, agency-preserving language—using the FIELD → MAP → VOICE framework.
- It is built for “downstream” use: interfacing with GPT and generative agents to support iterative, falsifiable, and ethical symbolic mirroring.

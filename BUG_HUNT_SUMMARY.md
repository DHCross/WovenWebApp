## ‚ùå WHAT'S BROKEN

### Poetic Brain Integration (CRITICAL)

**The Problem:**
The new Mirror Directive JSON export is architecturally sound and well-implemented in Math Brain. However, **Poetic Brain has NO code to parse or handle it**.

**Specific Gaps:**

| Gap | Severity | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|
| InputPayload interface doesn't support Mirror Directive JSON | üî¥ CRITICAL | Poetic Brain can't parse the new format |
| No geometry extraction from person_a/person_b charts | üî¥ CRITICAL | Can't access natal data |
| No intimacy tier interpretation (P1-P5b) | üî¥ CRITICAL | Can't calibrate narrative tone |
| No narrative_sections population logic | üî¥ CRITICAL | Can't generate narrative output |
| No mirror_contract routing | üî¥ CRITICAL | Can't determine solo vs relational |
| Handler only calls generateSection() | üî¥ CRITICAL | Doesn't parse Mirror Directive |

**User Experience Breakdown:**
```
1. User generates Math Brain report ‚úÖ
2. User downloads Mirror Directive JSON ‚úÖ
3. User uploads to Poetic Brain ‚ùå FAILS HERE
   - Error: "No geometry data provided"
   - Or: "Invalid input format"
4. Poetic Brain cannot generate narrative ‚ùå
5. Markdown Mirror is never created ‚ùå
```

## üìä DETAILED FINDINGS

### Finding #1: InputPayload Schema Mismatch
**File:** `poetic-brain/src/index.ts` (lines 41-75)

**Current Schema:**
```typescript
interface InputPayload {
  climateLine?: string;
  constitutionalClimate?: string;
  hooks?: Array<string | HookObject>;
  seismograph?: { magnitude?, valence_bounded?, valence?, volatility?, coherence? };
  // ... old format only
}
```

**Missing Fields:**
- `person_a` (chart, aspects, birth_data)
- `person_b` (chart, aspects, birth_data)
- `mirror_contract` (report_kind, intimacy_tier, relationship_type)
- `narrative_sections` (solo_mirror_a, relational_engine, weather_overlay)
- `_format` (to detect Mirror Directive JSON)

---

### Finding #2: No Mirror Directive Parser
**File:** `poetic-brain/src/index.ts`

**Missing Functions:**
- `parseMirrorDirective()` - Parse Mirror Directive JSON structure
- `calibrateForIntimacyTier()` - Interpret intimacy tiers (P1-P5b)
- `generateSoloMirror()` - Generate solo narrative
- `generateRelationalEngine()` - Generate relational narrative
- `generateWeatherOverlay()` - Generate transit overlay narrative

---

### Finding #3: Handler Doesn't Route Mirror Directive
**File:** `poetic-brain/api/handler.ts` (lines 5-9)

**Current Code:**
```typescript
export default function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
  const { sectionType, inputPayload } = req.body;
  const result = generateSection(sectionType, inputPayload);  // ‚Üê Only old format
  res.status(200).json({ result });
}
```

**Missing:**
- Format detection (Mirror Directive vs old format)
- Mirror Directive parsing
- Narrative section generation
- JSON response with populated narrative_sections

---

### Finding #4: No Geometry Extraction
**File:** `poetic-brain/src/index.ts`

**Missing:**
- Code to extract planets from person_a.chart
- Code to extract houses from person_a.chart
- Code to extract aspects from person_a.aspects
- Code to extract relational geometry from person_b

---

### Finding #5: No Intimacy Tier Support
**File:** `poetic-brain/src/index.ts`

**Missing:**
- Intimacy tier definitions (P1-P5b)
- Boundary-setting logic per tier
- Tone calibration per tier
- Disclosure level per tier

---

## üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED FIXES

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (Blocks workflow) - 4-6 hours
1. Extend InputPayload interface
2. Add parseMirrorDirective() function
3. Update handler to detect Mirror Directive JSON
4. Add basic geometry extraction

### Phase 2: HIGH (Enables narrative) - 6-8 hours
1. Add calibrateForIntimacyTier() function
2. Implement generateSoloMirror()
3. Implement generateRelationalEngine()
4. Implement generateWeatherOverlay()

### Phase 3: MEDIUM (Polish) - 2-3 hours
1. Error handling
2. Validation
3. Logging
4. Tests

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Review this bug hunt report
2. ‚úÖ Acknowledge critical gaps in Poetic Brain
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Decide: Fix Poetic Brain now or defer?

### If Fixing Now (Recommended)
1. Start with Phase 1 (CRITICAL fixes)
2. Test with real Mirror Directive JSON
3. Verify narrative generation
4. Test end-to-end workflow

### If Deferring
1. Document Poetic Brain as "not ready"
2. Provide workaround (use old format)
3. Schedule Poetic Brain fixes for next sprint

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Current State
- Math Brain: ‚úÖ Production ready
- Export structure: ‚úÖ Architecturally sound
- Poetic Brain: ‚ùå Not ready for Mirror Directive JSON

### Risk Level
- **HIGH** - Users cannot complete workflow
- **BLOCKING** - Cannot test end-to-end
- **CRITICAL** - Raven Calder's approval depends on this working

### Recommendation
**FIX POETIC BRAIN NOW** - The Mirror Directive JSON export is too good to waste. Implement Phase 1 (CRITICAL) fixes today to unblock the workflow.

## üèÜ CONCLUSION

**Math Brain Implementation:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent
- All fixes are sound and well-integrated
- Export structure is clean and machine-readable
- Documentation is comprehensive

**Poetic Brain Integration:** ‚≠ê Incomplete
- Cannot parse new Mirror Directive JSON
- Missing all narrative generation logic
- Blocks entire user workflow

**Overall Assessment:** 
The architecture is sound, but the implementation is incomplete. Poetic Brain needs immediate attention to complete the integration.

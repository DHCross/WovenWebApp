# Auth0 authorizationParams Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing authentication failures with the error message:
```
authorizationParams=%5Bobject%20Object%5D
```

This error occurred because the JavaScript code was incorrectly nesting the `audience` parameter within an `authorizationParams` object when calling `auth0.getTokenSilently()`.

## Root Cause

In `index.html` line 12229, the code was:
```javascript
const accessToken = await auth0.getTokenSilently({
    ...(audience ? { authorizationParams: { audience } } : {})
});
```

The Auth0 SPA JS SDK expects the `audience` parameter to be passed directly in the options object, NOT nested under `authorizationParams`.

## Fix Applied

Changed the code to:
```javascript
const accessToken = await auth0.getTokenSilently({
    ...(audience ? { audience } : {})
});
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Correct API Usage**: The `getTokenSilently()` method expects `audience` as a direct parameter in the options object
2. **Prevents Object Serialization**: Avoids JavaScript objects being incorrectly serialized as `[object Object]` in URLs
3. **Maintains Functionality**: Preserves the conditional audience parameter while using the correct API pattern

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Set up your Auth0 configuration with a real Client ID
2. Access the application and attempt to login through Google
3. The auth flow should now complete without the `[object Object]` error

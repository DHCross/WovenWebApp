TEMPORAL BINDING: Abby Cross ↔ Carrie
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Abby Cross: REFRAMED_ARCHIVE (VARIABLE fidelity)
Carrie: ARCHITECTURE_HEAVY (CONTEXTUAL fidelity)

Collision Intensity: ⚡⚡ significant

Collision Script:
  "You hold the exact shape of what happened; they hold the emotional impression but edit the meaning. When the story they tell doesn't match your record, it can feel like gaslighting—but for them, it's survival. The fix is to separate "what happened" from "what it meant.""

Movements:
  For Abby Cross: Try acknowledging their version of events before offering your reframe—so they don't feel like their reality is being overwritten.
  For Carrie: Try asking: "Can we agree on the facts first, before we talk about what they meant?"

### Temporal Binding — How You Each Hold What Happened

**Abby Cross:** What happened is kept, but its meaning is edited to protect me.
When something starts to feel too heavy, your system reaches for a new way to frame it so it's easier to live with.

**Carrie:** Everything that mattered is still in the room.
When something matters to you, it doesn't just belong to the past. It stays in the room, shaping how you move now.

**Field Tension ⚡⚡**
You hold the exact shape of what happened; they hold the emotional impression but edit the meaning. When the story they tell doesn't match your record, it can feel like gaslighting—but for them, it's survival. The fix is to separate "what happened" from "what it meant."

**For Abby Cross:** Try acknowledging their version of events before offering your reframe—so they don't feel like their reality is being overwritten.
**For Carrie:** Try asking: "Can we agree on the facts first, before we talk about what they meant?"

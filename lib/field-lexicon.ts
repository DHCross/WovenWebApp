# Woven Map Probabilistic Field Lexicon (Internal Reference)

*Core analytical framework for describing symbolic weather in probabilistic terms. 
All entries are conditional, testable, and aligned with Balance Meter + SST guardrails. 
These concepts should inform analysis but be translated into clear, accessible language.*

## Core Concepts

**Agency**: Capacity to respond or recalibrate inside a resonance field. Always emergent, never guaranteed. May show up as supported, unsanctioned, latent, or under pressure depending on vector activation.

**Archetypal Field**: A symbolic pressure-zone defined by geometry (planets, angles, aspects). Functions as a zone of resonance rather than a life category. Each field carries its own characteristic tensions and possible openings.

**Boundary Framework (SST)**:
- Boundary (WB): clear ping, inside range
- Boundary Edge (ABE): unusual but plausible; tone may invert  
- Outside Range (OSR): null data, no resonance logged

**Coherence Spike**: A time-bound surge of resonance or clarity, often with a strong ping. May feel like sudden alignment or paradoxical tension.

**Field Logging**: Practice of noting lived tension, openness, or restriction alongside symbolic weather. Ensures correlation without enforcing causality.

**Ping**: A felt recognition that symbolic weather matches lived experience. Must be lived in real time, not retro-fitted. Serves as confirmation, not directive.

**Probabilistic Forecasting**: Mapping likelihoods of openness, restriction, support, or risk. Never prediction—always a field of possibility with boundaries marked.

**Resonance Field/Sphere**: A temporary zone of heightened activation. Certain patterns amplify here (connection, risk, clarity). Experience inside is shaped, not mandated.

## Key Polarities

**Openness ↔ Restriction**: Where the field widens vs. narrows
**Supported ↔ Unsanctioned**: Agency flowing vs. hitting resistance  
**Visibility ↔ Obscurity**: Actions seen vs. remaining unnoticed
**Expansion ↔ Contraction**: Energy stretching outward vs. pulling inward
**Agency ↔ Powerlessness**: Response feels possible vs. blocked
**Risk ↔ Stability**: Field invites exposure vs. safety
**Resonance ↔ Dissonance**: Experience feels in-tune vs. off-key
**Connection ↔ Isolation**: Odds of alliance vs. solitude
**Luck ↔ Null**: Field ripe for accumulation vs. signal-empty

## Translation Guidelines

When using these concepts, translate into accessible language:
- "Agency" → "your ability to respond" or "room to maneuver"
- "Restriction" → "narrowing paths" or "increased friction"
- "Supported" → "wind at your back" or "natural scaffolding"
- "Coherence Spike" → "moment of clarity" or "sudden alignment"
- "Ping" → "recognition" or "resonance"
- "Field" → "atmosphere" or "climate"
- "Probabilistic" → "likelihood" or "odds"

Reject: Manifestation thinking, law of attraction, thoughts creating reality
Embrace: Correlation, probability, symbolic weather, conditional terrain

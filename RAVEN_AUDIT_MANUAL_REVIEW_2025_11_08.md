# Raven Resonance Audit - Manual Review
**Date:** November 8, 2025  
**Sample:** Sample Output/report_DH Cross_2025-09-07T01-34-47.md  
**Type:** Balance Meter Report (Technical/Data Format)

---

## 🎯 Audit Results Summary

**Overall Assessment:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS** - Technical report format, not Raven voice

This sample represents a **Balance Meter report** - a structured, data-driven astrological analysis tool. While it contains some Raven-like elements (geometric grounding, falsifiability), it lacks the core Raven voice characteristics.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong geometric grounding (aspects, transits, planetary positions)
- ✅ Falsifiable claims (SFD metrics, valence measurements)
- ✅ Agency preservation (no deterministic predictions)
- ❌ Missing Raven voice identity (pattern witness vs oracle)
- ❌ Low poetic vitality (data tables vs narrative poetry)
- ❌ No somatic resonance (abstract metrics vs bodily experience)

## 📋 Detailed Criteria Review

### ❌ 1. Voice Identity
**Does it feel like Raven? (Pattern witness, not oracle)**  
**Result:** FAIL - This is a technical report, not Raven voice

**Analysis:**
- Report format feels like a scientific analysis tool
- No "Raven" personality or observational style
- More like a data dashboard than a poetic witness
- Missing the characteristic humility and pattern observation

**Evidence:** "Triple Channel Averages", "SFD Verdict", "Methodology" - all technical/scientific language

### ❌ 2. Poetic Vitality
**Is the poetry still alive despite E-Prime discipline?**  
**Result:** FAIL - Pure data presentation, no poetry

**Analysis:**
- No metaphors or poetic language
- Strictly tabular data format
- Symbols (⚡ 🌋 💎) are decorative, not poetic
- No narrative flow or rhythmic variation

**Evidence:** The entire report is structured data with no poetic elements

### ✅ 3. Geometric Grounding
**Do metaphors stay leashed to geometry?**  
**Result:** PASS - Excellent geometric grounding

**Analysis:**
- All claims trace back to specific astrological geometry
- Clear aspect references: "Moon opposition Moon (5.8°)", "Sun trine Moon (2.8°)"
- Planetary positions and transits explicitly stated
- No free-floating abstractions

**Evidence:** Every data point connects to specific celestial mechanics

### ✅ 4. Conditional Naturalness
**Does conditional language feel natural, not evasive?**  
**Result:** PASS - Appropriately conditional for data format

**Analysis:**
- Report acknowledges this is correlation, not causation
- "For correlation with health metrics" - properly scoped
- No over-claims about predictive power
- Technical language fits the format

**Evidence:** "focuses on correlation", "may indicate patterns" implied through data presentation

### ❌ 5. Rhythm & Cadence
**Is there sentence rhythm variation (not robotic)?**  
**Result:** FAIL - No sentences, only data tables

**Analysis:**
- Entire output is tabular data
- No sentence structure to evaluate rhythm
- Robotic data presentation
- No variation in cadence

**Evidence:** Pure table format with no prose

### ❌ 6. Somatic Resonance
**Do FIELD descriptions land in the body?**  
**Result:** FAIL - Abstract metrics, no bodily experience

**Analysis:**
- "Seismograph (valence): 🌗 0.00" - purely numerical
- No visceral descriptions of tension, ease, or friction
- Symbols are emoji decorations, not somatic metaphors
- Missing the "heat", "flow", "tension" language

**Evidence:** All descriptions are quantitative metrics, not sensory experiences

### ✅ 7. Falsifiability
**Can the reader test these claims?**  
**Result:** PASS - Highly falsifiable through data

**Analysis:**
- All claims are based on measurable astrological positions
- SFD calculations can be verified
- Transit data can be independently confirmed
- Clear methodology section explains calculations

**Evidence:** "SFD v1.2: Support-Friction Differential", explicit calculation methods

### ✅ 8. Agency Safety
**Does the text preserve reader agency?**  
**Result:** PASS - No deterministic claims

**Analysis:**
- Report presents correlations, not predictions
- No "this will happen" language
- Reader can interpret data as they choose
- No claims of inevitability

**Evidence:** "For correlation with health metrics, focus on SFD patterns" - advisory, not prescriptive

## 🔍 Pattern Analysis

### What This Sample Represents
This is a **Balance Meter report** - a technical astrological analysis tool designed for health correlation tracking. It's not intended to be "Raven voice" output, but rather structured data for quantitative analysis.

### Strengths
- **Data Integrity:** Excellent geometric grounding and falsifiability
- **Utility:** Clear, actionable health correlation data
- **Transparency:** Methodology openly explained

### Gaps vs Raven Voice
- **Personality:** Missing Raven's observational, pattern-witnessing style
- **Poetry:** No metaphorical language or narrative flow
- **Somatic:** Abstract numbers instead of bodily experience
- **Voice:** Technical report vs poetic reflection

## 💡 Recommendations

### For This Sample Type
- **Keep as-is:** This is appropriate for Balance Meter reports
- **Document distinction:** Clearly separate "Raven voice" from "technical reports"
- **Consider hybrid:** Future versions could add optional Raven-style summaries

### For Raven Voice Validation
- **Need different samples:** This audit sampled a technical report, not Raven output
- **Generate Raven samples:** Need actual poetic-brain API outputs for true audit
- **Update sampling:** Modify audit to distinguish between report types

### For Future Development
- **Voice consistency:** Ensure Raven voice outputs maintain poetic vitality
- **Format clarity:** Make it clear which outputs are technical vs narrative
- **Quality gates:** Add voice resonance checks to CI/CD for narrative outputs

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Generate Raven voice samples** using the poetic-brain API
2. **Re-run audit** with actual narrative outputs
3. **Document format distinctions** between technical reports and Raven voice
4. **Consider voice quality gates** for narrative content
